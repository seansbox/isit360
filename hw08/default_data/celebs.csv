Born in Paris, Claudette Colbert moved to New York when her banker father encountered financial setbacks. Initially intending to become a commercial artist, she studied with speech teacher Alice Rossetter to overcome a slight lisp. Rossetter encouraged Colbert to audition for a play she had just written, ""The Widow's Veil"" (1919), and so one of the most durable careers in show business began with an appearance as an Irish bride (complete with red wig and brogue)."
2,Clark Gable,2/1/1901,"Cadiz, Ohio, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/kj4bsof_fDcSubp5w29JaFqBcAY=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/73396_v9_ba.jpg,"The definition of American masculinity, Clark Gable was officially proclaimed the ""King of Hollywood"" during his Golden Age heyday. Initially considered too rough-hewn to play the romantic lead, Gable's virile persona soon earned him scores of fans in films like ""A Free Soul"" (1931), ""Red Dust"" (1932) and ""San Francisco"" (1936). He won an Oscar for his role in Frank Capra's ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), made women swoon as Fletcher Christian in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), and charmed as roguish Rhett Butler in the epic ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939). Gable's delivery of the latter film's classic line, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" was soon among the most quoted in the history of cinema. After distinguishing himself in combat during World War II with the Army Air Corps, Gable returned to Hollywood in 1945, albeit with a noticeably diminished spark. Although many of his late-career efforts were unremarkable, there were exceptions, such as the jungle adventure ""Mogambo"" (1953) and the naval action-drama ""Run Silent, Run Deep"" (1958). His final performance, however, also proved to be one of his best, when he was cast opposite Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift in ""The Misfits"" (1961). As befitting his iconic stature, America was informed of Gable's sudden passing with the reverent headline ""The King is Dead."""

A true rags-to-riches story himself, Capra started his career as a comedy writer for vaudeville star Harry Langdon before turning to directing during the silent era. In 1931, he began his lifelong collaboration with writer Robert Riskin on socially-conscious films like ""American Madness"" (1932) and ""Lady for a Day"" (1933), which led to Oscar glory with the classic screwball comedy ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), the first movie to ever sweep the five major Academy Award categories. Capra then entered a fruitful period with ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" (1936), which he followed with the classic ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939), starring James Stewart, who came to exemplify the director's prototypical idealist. During World War II, Capra made several acclaimed wartime propaganda movies, including ""Prelude to War"" (1942), which won the Oscar for Best Documentary. Upon returning to Hollywood, he reunited with Stewart on ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946), a heartwarming tale that failed at the box office, but later became a perennial holiday classic. The director would make several more films over the next two decades before officially retiring and moving out of Hollywood, but ""It's a Wonderful Life"" would be his crowning achievement. With a career that celebrated patriotism, idealism and small-town American values, Capra's strength as a filmmaker marked him as a true giant of Hollywood's Golden Age."

Riskin first worked with Capra on the religious-themed drama ""The Miracle Woman"" (1931) and bleak comedy ""The Platinum Blonde"" (1931) before collaborating on their first truly great film, ""Lad for a Day"" (1933). But it was the classic screwball comedy ""It Happened One Night"" (1934) that helped define both their careers and lived on as one of the greatest examples of the genre. Of course, his work was not limited to Capra, and Riskin wrote for other luminaries of his day like John Ford and William Wellman. But it was with Capra that he did his finest work, as exemplified by ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"" (1936), ""Lost Horizon"" (1937) and ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938). Tired of Capra taking credit for his work, Riskin made his last film with the director, ""Meet John Doe"" (1941), before branching off on his own. Following his service in the war, he wrote ""The Thin Man Goes Home"" (1944), ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" (1946) and ""Riding High"" (1950). Riskin suffered a debilitating stroke in 1950, though he received credit for ""Here Comes the Groom"" (1951) and ""Pocketful of Miracles"" (1961), which were written before his illness.

Having started off as a performer on stage, most notably with John Houseman, with whom he formed the famed Mercury Theatre, Welles used his distinctive baritone voice to create innovative radio dramas. He became famous - notorious, even - following his 1938 broadcast of H.G. Wells' ""War of the Worlds,"" which he presented as a real time news event, sparking panic among listeners who thought Martians really were invading New Jersey. The fame he achieved in the wake of the broadcast attracted RKO Pictures, where he made the most stunning directorial debut in the history of cinema with ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), long considered to be the greatest film ever made. Using innovative narrative and technological techniques, Welles singlehandedly changed the face of cinema, earning the nickname the Boy Wonder. He went on to direct ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), though both films were financial failures that prompted his exit from RKO. After marrying Love Goddess Rita Hayworth and directing ""The Stranger"" (1946) and ""Macbeth"" (1948), Welles began a 10-year self-imposed Hollywood exile that saw him appear onscreen in movies like ""The Third Man"" (1949) while directing well-received films overseas like ""Othello"" (1952) and ""Mr. Arkadin"" (1955). He returned to Hollywood to helm ""Touch of Evil"" (1958), a classic film noir, while suffering a commercial drubbing with his adaptation of Franz Kafka's ""The Trial"" (1962). His take on Shakespeare's famed character, Falstaff, in ""Chimes at Midnight"" (1966) again earned international acclaim despite being largely ignored in the United States. Though he fell on hard times in the 1970s, Welles nonetheless remained busy with numerous projects in various stages of completion while appearing onscreen in a number of performances and using his distinctive voice in a variety of narrator roles.  When he died in 1985, Welles left behind a legacy as a consummate artist and true auteur whose influence was profoundly felt by several generations of filmmakers."

Born in Clinton, Massachusetts, her family relocated to St. Louis, Missouri when Moorehead was a child. During childhood Moorehead began to show a talent for mimicry and expressed a desire to become an actress. Moorehead graduated from Muskingum College in 1923, with a major in biology. During her time at college she appeared in several plays, after which she taught public school for 5 years and earned a master's in public speaking and English at University of Wisconsin-Madison.  When her career began after a course of study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, things were shaky for a while. She struggled with unemployment until she got a start in radio, a medium where she excelled. She struggled to breakthrough in film, however, and spent years working in Orson Welles Mercury Players, and her film debut came in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) when she played the mother of Welles's character. She appeared the following year in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"", and the following year in ""Journey Into Fear"" (1943).  Moorehead went on to play significantly more noticeable roles in films like ""The Big Street"" (1942), ""Mrs. Parkington"" (1944) and ""The Youngest Profession"" (1944). Moorehead was soon under contract to MGM with an atypical clause stipulating that she appear in any radio projects that the studio was working on. Moorehead appeared in a number of television series throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, but nothing resonated with audiences more than her portrayal of Endora, the witch mother of Elizabeth Montgomery's character Samantha. She was recognized for her work on the show a number of times but always claimed that she felt trapped by the role. Agnes Moorehead died in 1974 from uterine cancer in Rochester, Minnesota."

Like many of the Mercury group, Stewart followed Welles out to Hollywood to make a career in the movies. He co-starred in Welles's ground-breaking cinematic debut, ""Citizen Kane,"" playing newspaper mogul Kane's butler. More work followed, with many directors utilizing Stewart's taciturn, gruff demeanor to good effect in crime and war melodramas. After World War II, Stewart co-starred with Gregory Peck in the aerial combat film ""Twelve O'Clock High,"" played a boxing manager opposite Kirk Douglas in the fight drama ""Champion,"" and starred alongside Dana Andrews and Farley Granger in the film noir ""Edge of Doom.""

He wrote or collaborated on dozens of pictures during the silent era, and with the advent of sound, produced early Marx Brothers classics like ""Monkey Business"" (1930), ""Horse Feathers"" (1932) and ""Duck Soup"" (1933). He also worked frequently with W.C. Fields, including on ""Million Dollar Legs"" (1932), and was at the peak of his career in the early 1930s. Following this, he had some years of struggle, and Mankiewicz was on the outs with Hollywood for a time, until Welles brought him on to write ""Citizen Kane."" Despite controversy from its unflattering portrayal of William Randolph Hearst and a dispute about writing credit, Mankiewicz won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

Forced out of his lucrative international grain business by the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Houseman found a creative outlet alongside wunderkind Orson Welles at the Federal Theater Project. Frequently controversial productions produced and directed by Houseman and Welles included the 1935 ""voodoo"" version of ""Macbeth"" and the historic labor union musical ""The Cradle Will Rock"" in 1936. After forming the Mercury Theater Company - responsible for the infamous ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast in 1938 - with Welles, he followed the young auteur to Hollywood, where he made significant contributions to ""Citizen Kane"" (1941).

The Juilliard School graduate began his remarkable career at CBS, firstly as a conductor where he forged a reputation as a champion of new and unknown music, and secondly as a protege of Orson Welles, arranging scores for dozens of the director's radio productions as well as his big-screen masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). Herrmann won the only Oscar of his career for his work on ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" (1941) but it was his nine-year partnership with Alfred Hitchcock, and work on ""Vertigo"" (1958) and ""Psycho"" (1960) in particular, that elevated him into the realm of all-time greats. Herrmann's collaborations with Dynamation pioneer Ray Harryhausen further cemented his status, and although he later rejected Hollywood for its hit-chasing obsession, his music remained omnipresent in a new wave of American cinema helmed by the likes of Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese. Despite his sudden death the day after completing work on the latter's ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), Herrmann's classical and film compositions continued to make a significant cultural impact throughout the following half-century."

He was that rarity among technicians--a cinematographer eager to accept technological advances and apply them creatively to the narrative film form. Toland's talent was readily accepted by the Hollywood establishment, who graced him with a charmed life amid the workmanlike atmosphere pervading most studio productions. Contracted throughout his career to Samuel Goldwyn (although he was lent to other producers), Toland was permitted more freedom than most cinematographers of his time, from being allowed his choice of crew and story properties to converting studio cameras to his own specifications. Working with such outstanding directors as Howard Hawks, William Wyler, John Ford and Orson Welles, Toland was in the unique position of incorporating technological innovations into equally innovative narrative frameworks."

At the beginning of his career, he worked with equal facility in horror (""The Curse of the Cat People"") (1944), film noir (""Born to Kill"") (1947), Westerns (""Blood on the Moon"") (1948), sports (""The Set-Up"") (1949) and sci-fi (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"") (1951), demonstrating a visual and narrative dexterity that other filmmakers could only marvel at. After earning his stripes in the 1950s, Wise went on to become one of the most successful and revered directors of the following decade, winning four Oscars for his work on the musical extravaganzas ""West Side Story"" (1961) and ""The Sound of Music"" (1965). As film budgets - and studio expectations - skyrocketed, more personal projects, such as the uncompromising Steve McQueen war drama ""The Sand Pebbles"" (1966), became increasingly difficult for Wise to mount. And although one of his final directorial efforts, the big-budget spectacular ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" (1979), may not have been greeted with the unqualified praise the studio had hoped for, it nonetheless demonstrated the work of a master craftsman, still in full possession of his artistic powers. When responding to the charges of some that Wise never left a personal, artistic imprint on his films, the director replied that it was not the director's job to tailor the film to themselves, but rather, to tailor themselves to the film."

She was born into a family of vaudevillians and joined her older sisters in performing at their parents' Minnesota theater at a young age. The Gumm family relocated to Lancaster, CA in 1926, and Garland began studying dance properly two years later. Following a few years of performing in stage productions and film shorts with her siblings, a 13-year-old Garland was signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1935. Some of her earliest features included ""Thoroughbreds Don't Cry"" (1937) and ""Love Finds Andy Hardy"" (1938), both of which costarred Mickey Rooney. All the while, Garland began what would become long-term abuse of amphetamines and barbiturates, as provoked by the studio system. Within two years of her breaking out as a solo act, Garland landed what would be the most iconic role of her career: Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1938). The 1940s saw Garland take on more adult-oriented roles, beginning with ""Little Nellie Kelly"" (1940), and experience her first marriage-to composer David Rose in 1941, as well as their divorce three years later. She would go on to star in the smash hit ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" (1944) and experiment with non-musical drama in the critically revered ""The Clock"" (1945). Shortly afterward, she married Vincent Minelli, with whom she'd bear daughter Liza Minelli. In the late 1940s, Garland suffered her first suicide attempt and was hospitalized briefly. The stint preceded her first commercial failure in a decade, ""The Pirate"" (1947), though Garland earned far more successful returns with the following year's ""Easter Parade"" (1948). Nevertheless, Garland's acting slowed in the 1950s, during which time she appeared only in ""Summer Stock"" (1950) and the now iconic ""A Star Is Born"" (1954). Also during this period, Garland married Sidney Luft and gave birth to Lorna Luft. In the 1960s, Garland starred in dramas including ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961) and John Cassavetes' ""A Child Is Waiting"" (1963), and, her final picture, the musical ""I Could Go on Singing"" (1963). She then headlined her own variety musical program ""The Judy Garland Show"" (CBS 1963-64). On June 22, 1969, Garland died at age 47 following a barbiturate overdose."

He first established himself on stage, making regular appearances on Broadway in such major productions as ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1926-27) and ""The Band Wagon"" (1931-32). Morgan was already featured in movies by that point, but really hit his stride in the 1930s, earning an Academy Award nomination for ""The Affairs of Cellini"" (1934) and distinguishing himself in notable pictures like ""The Good Fairy"" (1935) and ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (1936). His most famous screen credit, however, was the musical/fantasy classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), where he was wonderfully memorable in no less than five roles. He displayed excellent dramatic form in ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (1940) and ""The Mortal Storm"" (1940), and a second Oscar nomination followed for ""Tortilla Flat"" (1942). MGM was so pleased with the consistency of Morgan's vibrant and delightful performances that he was with the company from the early 1930s right up until his premature death in 1949. Specializing in characters that were usually a bit befuddled and flustered, but motivated by honorable intentions, Morgan endeared himself to audiences everywhere and remained one of Hollywood's most beloved supporting players long after his passing."

Born to a German immigrant father in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, the precocious Lahr dropped out of school at age 15 and quickly found success with the Seven Frolics, a children's stage act. Altering his last name from Lahrheim to Lahr, he went on to a successful career as a burlesque comic (performing ""Dutch"" characters, replete with accent) and later in an act paired with his future wife Mercedes Delpino, eventually playing the Palace Theater in 1925. After debuting on Broadway in ""Harry Delmar's Revels"" in 1927, Lahr had his first major success in a stage musical playing the prize fighter hero of ""Hold Everything"" (1928-29). Several other musicals followed, notably ""Flying High"" (1930), Ziegfeld's ""Hot-Cha!"" (1932) and ""The Show Is On"" (1936), which teamed him with Beatrice Lillie in a show conceived and directed by Vincente Minnelli.

Quote her most famous line, however, and watch their eyes blink awake with recognition: ""I'll get you my pretty! ....and your little dog, too!"" The woman behind of cinema's most iconic villains, Cleveland-born Margaret Brainard Hamilton was, as a young girl, enchanted by L. Frank Baum's fantastical Oz tales, and impulsively drawn to the theater. Decades later, with her Technicolor-green visage, reverberating cackle, and nightmarish troop of flying monkeys, Hamilton terrified generations of children in the classic MGM musical, ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Ironic, perhaps, given her inherently kind-hearted nature, but telling, no doubt, of her monumental talent and unwavering commitment to craft. The imaginative daughter of prominent lawyer, Hamilton's benevolent disposition and love of children made her a natural in her initial career as a kindergarten teacher (a profession her parents encouraged for practical reasons). Even so, she never gave up on her dream of becoming an actor. In 1923, at the age of 21, Hamilton made her stage debut in a Cleveland Play House production of ""The Man Who Ate Popomac."" Her talent blossoming over the course of the next three years, Hamilton made considerable wear on those sturdy midwestern boards. And while it was without question a big step to Broadway, Hamilton made the stride effortlessly with her Broadway debut in a Majestic Theater production of ""Another Language."" Â So memorable was Hamilton in the role of a waspish spinster that Hollywood producers lured her to the West Coast to reprise the character in the 1936 film adaptation of the same name. On the big screen, Hamilton's withering sneer registered stronger than ever, and vicious tongue lashings cracked through the air in those cavernous movie houses like a bullwhip in an arena. Three years later, Hamilton showed a gentler side in Chatterbox (1936). Though her stern screen presence and impeccable rapid-fire delivery brought her steady work throughout the 1930s, those same traits also led to her being typecast as the busybody spinster or the disapproving aunt. Meanwhile, at MGM, preparations were being made to adapt one of Baum's beloved Oz stories to the big screen. Hamilton read in the trades that Gail Sundergaard was planning to go glamorous with her interpretation of the dreaded Wicked Witch of the West. Around this time, Hamilton and her agent Jeff Smith were attending a football game when they recognized Producer Mervyn LeRoy in the crowd. When LeRoy expressed interest in working with Hamilton, Smith started bargaining. Initially, Hamilton was hired to work on The Wizard of Oz for six weeks. By the time the shoot wrapped, Hamilton had not only worked a total of twenty-three weeks, but also suffered second and third-degree burns during the scene in which her character makes a flashfire exit from Munchkinland Of course it's widely known today that The Wizard of Oz, despite being adored by critics and nominated for six Academy Awards, wasn't exactly a financial windfall for MGM. In fact, the film that would forever change the landscape of American pop culture failed to turn a profit until the re-release a decade later."

Making his belated feature film debut at 60, Grapewin carved a niche for himself in Hollywood playing a succession of judges, doctors, civil servants and the occasional millionaire in such films as ""Alice Adams"" (1935) with Katharine Hepburn, ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936) with Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis, and ""Captains Courageous"" (1937) with Spencer Tracy. Lured away from retirement with the role of Uncle Henry in ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), Grapewin attained a measure of cult immortality but more immediate was acclaim from his collaborations with director John Ford, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940) and ""Tobacco Road"" (1941). His endearing onscreen presence won Grapewin a recurring role as amateur sleuth Ellery Queen's father in the long-running series, beginning with ""Inspector Ellery Queen"" (1940) and comprising eight films. Following the death of his wife, actress Anna Chance, in 1943, Grapewin worked less frequently after World War II. He retired in 1950 on the heels of playing a grandfather who reflects on his tragic childhood in ""When I Grow Up"" (1951). Grapewin's death in 1956 in no way diminished the actor's stock in the eyes of moviegoers, who had long since enshrined him as the kindly Uncle whose love pointed Judy Garland toward cinematic history at the end of the Yellow Brick Road."

52,L. Frank Baum,1856-05-15,"Chittenango, New York, USA",/assets/pizza-pie/images/poster_default.c8c896e70c3.gif,"Author L.

Baum's work originated from his desire to supplant the frightening, often moralistic tone of European fairy tales with a more pleasing and imaginative brand of children's literature, which resulted in Oz and its 16 sequels, as well as dozens of other young reader books, many written under a variety of pen names. Baum frequently attempted to bring his books to a wide audience through stage and silent film adaptations, though none could encapsulate the grand scope and gentle magic of his written work. Ironically, it was the 1939 film version that ultimately kept his books relevant for generations of readers, preserving Baum's status as one of America's most popular children's authors."

Outfitted in tattered baggy pants, a cutaway coat and vest, impossibly large worn-out shoes and a battered derby hat, The Tramp appeared in untold numbers of short films and made Chaplin the first true Hollywood star. After making his debut in ""Kid Auto Races at Venice"" (1914), Chaplin's Tramp was the focus of many iconic films like ""The Tramp"" (1915), ""Behind the Screen"" (1916), ""Easy Street"" (1917) and ""The Immigrant"" (1917). With his output slowed down a bit after World War I, Chaplin entered into one of his most creatively satisfying periods that saw ""The Kid"" (1921), ""The Gold Rush"" (1925) and ""City Lights"" (1931) hit the screen. Chaplin was one of the last to bow down to pressure and succumb to the sound era with ""Modern Times"" (1936), in which he reluctantly agreed to allow the public to hear the Tramp's voice - the first and only time this occurred. Having retired the character for good, Chaplin - who was also a pioneering writer and director on many of his films - starred in what became his last truly exemplary film, ""The Great Dictator"" (1940), before outraging audiences with an atypical turn in the thriller ""Monsieur Verdoux"" (1947). His last ode to the Tramp, ""Limelight"" (1952), failed to reach American screens amidst the political witch hunts of the McCarthy era, which led to him permanently residing in Switzerland until his death in 1977. Despite the hardships endured later in his career, Chaplin remained one of Hollywood's true geniuses while his Tramp characterization became one of cinema's most recognizable and defining images."

With strong roots in theater, Boseman made a name for himself as a stage actor, director and playwright prior to landing notable screen roles. In 2003, he began appearing on television in one-off guest spots on various procedural dramas before joining the cast of the drama ""Lincoln Heights"" (ABC Family, 2007-09) as recurring character Nate Ray Taylor. Boseman subsequently found a regular part on the mysterious thriller series ""Persons Unknown"" (NBC, 2010), but the show was quickly cancelled. A starring role in the little-seen action movie ""The Kill Hole"" (2012) followed, but Boseman bounced back from this relative disappointment with the lead in Brian Helgeland's historical baseball drama ""42,"" a film that placed him squarely on the Hollywood map. Performances as James Brown in the biopic ""Get On Up"" (2014) and in the blockbusters ""Gods of Egypt"" (2016) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) maintained his standing as one of Hollywood's hottest young actors before his title performance in the blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018) made him an international superstar. Born in South Carolina, Chadwick Boseman gravitated towards the theater in his youth, going on to attend both Howard University in Washington, D.C. and the British American Dramatic Academy in Oxford, England. Establishing himself as a notable up-and-comer in African-American-centric theater productions, a number of which he wrote and directed, Boseman eventually set his sights on screen acting. Starting out in brief guest roles on procedural dramas such as ""Third Watch"" (NBC, 1999-2005) and ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010), he finally garnered more notable parts in 2008, with a supporting role in the football movie ""The Express"" and an extended arc on the family drama ""Lincoln Heights,"" where he played a troubled young war vet. Boseman was seemingly on the verge on his big break when he was cast as the key character of another military vet, Sergeant Graham McNair, in Christopher McQuarrie's high-concept mystery series ""Persons Unknown"" (NBC, 2010). Unfortunately, the show was cancelled after 13 episodes, leaving him to return to one-off appearances on various television dramas, including fan-favorite fare such as ""Fringe"" (Fox, 2008-2013) and ""Justified"" (FX, 2010-15). Following a featured turn in the widely panned low-budget action film ""The Kill Hole"" (2012), Boseman's fortunes changed considerably. Veteran Hollywood writer/director Brian Helgeland tapped Boseman to play the main role of pioneering baseball player Jackie Robinson in the hit drama ""42,"" a production that not only led to immediate recognition for his determined performance, but also found him acting alongside film icon Harrison Ford. After playing another athlete opposite Kevin Costner in Ivan Reitman's ""Draft Day"" (2014), Boseman took on the task of portraying another influential black figure of the 20th century in the James Brown biopic ""Get On Up"" (2014). Boseman next appeared in Alex Proyas' Biblical epic ""Gods of Egypt"" and as the superhero Black Panther in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) before gearing up for starring roles as Thurgood Marshall in ""Marshall"" (2016) and in his own superhero action fest, ""Black Panther"" (2018), which was a massive critical and commercial success upon its February 2018 release. Boseman returned to the role later that year in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018). He next starred in the action thriller ""21 Bridges"" (2019) and appeared in Spike Lee's Vietnam drama ""Da 5 Bloods"" (2020).

Hailing from Kenya by way of Mexico (where she was born in 1983) Nyong'o was the daughter of a Kenyan politician. In fact, it was during his time as a visiting lecturer in Mexico City that she came to be born in that country, with the family eventually moving back to Kenya when she was a year old. However, in addition to being sent back to Mexico by her parents later in life to learn Spanish, Nyong'o set out abroad for her education as well, this time to the United States to attend both Hampshire College and Yale University. During her time in school, she appeared in a number of stage productions. Following graduation, she made her initial foray into movies behind the camera, working on the production teams of films such as ""The Constant Gardener"" (2005) and ""The Namesake"" (2006). In 2009, she created, directed, produced and edited a documentary entitled ""In My Genes"" for her final thesis project at Hampshire. The project - focusing on the societal and personal challenges faced by Kenya's albino population - was a coming home for Nyong'o, who moved back to Nairobi around this time. Once there, she produced a video for MTV and eventually starred in a TV series, ""Shuga."" All of these achievements paled, however, compared to her casting as Patsey in director Steve McQueen's ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). Nyong'o's searing performance was widely praised by both critics and audiences, and resulted in the rising young star winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Following a supporting part in the Liam Neeson/Julianne Moore thriller ""Non-Stop"" (2014), Nyong'o next appeared in a motion-capture CGI role as Maz Katana in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), a role she repeated in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017). In between, Nyong'o essayed a voice role as Raksha in Jon Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" (2016) and starred opposite David Oyelowo in sports biography ""Queen of Katwe"" (2016).

Two years later, Gurira would enjoy her most prominent acting turn as the flinty zombie fighter Michonne on ""The Walking Dead"" (AMC, 2010- ).

With Nikkole Salter, she wrote the off-Broadway play, ""In the Continuum"" (2006), about the lives of two women infected with HIV, which won the Obie and Outer Critics Circle Awards for writing, while Gurira herself claimed the Helen Hayes Award for Best Lead Actress in 2007. That same year, she made her feature film debut in ""The Visitor"" (2007) as a young Senegalese woman who helped a widowed economics professor (Richard Jenkins) find joy and purpose in his life. Minor roles in ""Ghost Town"" (2008) and Wes Craven's ""My Soul to Take"" (2010) soon followed, as did Gurira's Broadway debut as an actress in a production of August Wilson's ""Joe Turner's Come and Gone"" in 2009. That same year, she premiered her second play, ""Eclipsed"" (2009), about a quartet of women held captive by a rebel leader during the war in Liberia in 2003. The production won Best New Play at the 2010 Helen Hayes Awards as well as Best Playwright for Gurira from the NAACP Theater Awards that same year. In 2011, she appeared in William Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure"" with the New York Shakespeare Festival, and then premiered her third play, ""The Convert,"" about a teenage girl in 19th century Zimbabwe who turned to Christianity to evade an arranged marriage. Like its predecessors, the play won several major theater awards, including the 2011 Stavis Award and Edgerton Foundation New American Plays Award. After enjoying a supporting role in a six-episode story arc on ""Treme"" (HBO, 2010-13), Gurira earned her breakout screen role as Michonne, a tough, resourceful new character on the third season of ""The Walking Dead""; Michonne immediately became not only a fan favorite, but one of the series' most important characters Gurira was subsequently cast as the lead in ""Mother of George"" (2013), an independent drama with an African setting. In addition to her acting and playwrighting careers, Gurira was co-founder of Almasi, an organization devoted to supporting arts education in Zimbabwe.

After gaining some attention in several stage musicals, Whitaker made an immediate impression with a small, but memorable role in his feature debut, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982). Following a quick succession of supporting roles in features and on television, he earned his first wave of critical accolades for his portrayal of drug-addicted jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker in ""Bird"" (1988). Once he was established as a viable leading man, Whitaker easily oscillated between low-budget and studio projects, earning equal acclaim for his performances. Taking his career to the next level, he made several forays into feature directing - most notably ""Waiting to Exhale"" (1995) - but continued to churn out one sterling performance after another until finally reaching new heights with his Oscar-winning portrayal of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland"" (2006), which came hot on the heels of another mesmerizing performance as an obsessive internal affairs officer on season five of ""The Shield"" (FX, 2002-08). Both roles only confirmed that Whitaker was one of Hollywood's most versatile, surprising and talented actors of his day. His work as a producer on films like ""Fruitvale Station"" (2013) and ""Dope"" (2015) helped shepherd a new generation of African-American filmmakers while his work in hits like ""The Butler"" (2013), ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" (2016) and ""Black Panther"" (2018) kept him firmly in audiences' minds."

And while its fully articulated appearance was a miracle of digital effects, the character would have had none of its impact were it not for the astonishing performance of Andy Serkis, the English actor who lent his voice and physical movements to the role. Serkis' turn, alternately tragic and treacherous, was hailed by critics worldwide; he would go on to give life to another Jackson digital creation - the title beast in ""King Kong"" (2005) - and prove himself a versatile talent in his own skin with notable supporting roles in ""13 Going on 30"" (2004), ""The Prestige"" (2006), and ""Longford"" (2006). The actor continued to earn acclaim for live-action roles in such U.K.-produced dramas as the Ian Dury biopic ""Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll"" (2010) and more stunning motion-capture work in box office hits like ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011). Fans later thrilled to the performer reprising the role of Gollum in Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" trilogy, along with performances in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011) and its sequel ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014), plus ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2014), ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015) and ""Black Panther"" (2018).

Brown was known to audiences everywhere for his acclaimed role on the TV series ""This is Us"" (NBC, 2016-), his path toward acting as a career was not always clear. Born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1976, Brown was primarily interested in sports like basketball and football, but after appearing in a school production of the musical ""Godspell,"" Brown discovered that he harbored a deep love of acting. Even still, he first enrolled at Stanford University as an economics major, performing in college plays on the side purely as a hobby-but only until he was forced to admit that performing was his true passion. While studying there his freshman year, Brown also met and began a relationship with fellow actor Ryan Michelle Bathe, whom he would later marry in 2007. Brown went on to earn an MFA from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, and began acting in regional theater productions to hone his skills. In 2002, he made his film debut with a small role in the romantic comedy ""Brown Sugar"" (2002). He played a recurring role on the drama ""Third Watch"" (NBC, 1999-2005) and continued to book small roles in films like ""Trust the Man"" (2005) and ""Stay"" (2005) before he landed a starring role on the drama series ""Army Wives"" (Lifetime, 2007-2013) in 2007. The show has a loyal fanbase, and Brown stuck with it for all of its seven seasons. When the series eventually wrapped in 2013, Brown's next big break was looming on the horizon, and it would prove to be a double-whammy. It came in 2016 when he was cast as Christopher Darden on the first season of the hotly anticipated anthology series ""American Crime Story"" (FX, 2016-), ""The People Vs. O.J. Simpson,"" in addition to landing his role as Randall Pearson on ""This is Us."" The popularity of both shows raised Brown's profile exponentially. Though ""American Crime Story"" moved on to a new story with a new cast for its ensuing seasons, ""This is Us"" became a cultural phenomenon. Brown proved a pivotal an extremely popular presence on the show, but he nonetheless continued to appear in steadily bigger movie productions as well,  joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the role of N'Jobu in ""Black Panther"" (2018), co-starring in the futuristic neo-noir ""Hotel Artemis"" (2018), and playing Traeger in the sci-fi action reboot ""The Predator"" (2018)."

Headlined by Academy Award-winner Whoopi Goldberg, the musical drama cast Kani as a school principal in his native South Africa. In 1996, director Stephen Hopkins tapped Kani to play Samuel, a native African assisting in the hunt of two deadly lions in the period thriller ""The Ghost and the Darkness,"" starring Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer. Kani's character provides the film's memorable narration. Kani made his directorial debut in 2009, an adaptation of his play ""Nothing But the Truth,"" which is set amidst the social turmoil of post-apartheid South Africa. Kani also played the lead role in the film.

Ryan Coogler was born on May 23, 1986 in Oakland, California. His mother was a community organizer, and his father was a probation officer. Coogler was an athletic child, and he attended Saint Mary's College of California on a football scholarship. There, he studied chemistry, though a professor encouraged him to look into screenwriting. Coogler transferred, eventually landing at the USC School Of Cinematic Arts. There, he began directing award-winning short films, which centered on true-to-life and often harrowing tales. Starting at age 21, Coogler worked with at-risk youth, following in his father's footsteps by working in the prison system. His next cinematic venture was ""Fruitvale,"" a feature-length film about the last 24 hours of Oscar Grant's life before he was shot by policemen in Coogler's hometown of Oakland in a manslaughter case that had gone mostly overlooked by the public. The film, renamed ""Fruitvale Station,"" starred Michael B. Jordan, Melonie Diaz, and Octavia Spencer, and Forest Whitaker was one of the producers. After winning much praise and many awards at Sundance and Cannes, it was released by The Weinstein Company to popular and critical success. In 2014, Coogler signed on to direct ""Creed,"" a ""Rocky"" spin-off also starring Michael B. Jordan.  Its critical and commercial success led to the biggest film of Coogler's career so far, ""Black Panther"" (2018). The first film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe to focus on a black lead character  with a majority-black cast, the film was not only a massive commercial success, it was hailed as a major move forward for African-American filmmakers in general."

A New York native, he began working as an assistant at Timely Comics in 1939. He worked his way into writing, beginning with an issue of ""Captain America."" He moved into editing while only 19, before leaving to serve in the Army during World War II. Despite his military commitments, Lee continued working on Timely titles from afar. Upon returning to civilian life, he worked on a variety of titles, and for a period wrote the newspaper comic strip ""My Friend Irma."" After the publisher became known as Marvel Comics, he was charged by his boss to come up with a superhero team that would rival DC Comics' Justice League of America. He joined with artist Jack Kirby to create The Fantastic Four comic book that debuted in 1961. The style of writing, with the characters that didn't always get along and struggled with knowing what the right thing was to do, was markedly different from what had come before. The success of the title kicked off an unprecedented creative outburst with Lee working with a team of artists to create new superheroes, including The Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Daredevil, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and The X-Men. Much like the DC team of heroes, the Marvel characters became joined in a group configuration called The Avengers. Lee became the voice of the comic books for legions of fans thanks to his letters to the editor forum that ran in issues, along with his column ""Stan's Soapbox."" He pushed his comics to deal with real issues, like racism and drug abuse. Even after largely stepping away from the day-to-day running of Marvel in the 1980s, Lee continued to act as the face of the company, making public appearances at fan conventions and tradeshows. Apart from Marvel, he worked on a variety of projects, typically under the umbrella of his companies, Stan Lee Media and POW! Entertainment.  Among his most successful non-Marvel creations was the animated series ""Stripperella"" (Spike TV, 2003-04), with the lead character voiced by Pamela Anderson. Despite having been the creative force behind their chief competition, he partnered with DC Comics in 2001 and 2002 on a series of comic books where Lee put his own spin on the company's stable of superheroes, including Batman and Superman. He also became a recognized figure in pop culture thanks to his cameo appearances in the Marvel films, starting with ""X-Men"" (2000) and ending with ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). His acting extended beyond Marvel, though, as he popped up on films such as Kevin Smith's ""Mallrats"" (1995) and television shows like ""The Big Bang Theory"" (CBS, 2007-19). Not limited to strictly on-screen work, he lent his voice to several animated projects, Marvel-related and otherwise, including ""The Simpsons"" (Fox, 1989- ). He also hosted the television shows ""Who Wants to Be a Superhero?"" (Sci-Fi Channel, 2006-07) and ""Stan Lee's Superhumans"" (History, 2010-14).

Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1978, Morrison first picked up her mother's vintage Olympus camera when she was still a small child and spent her youth snapping pictures. By the time she was enrolling at New York University, Morrison was unable to choose between film and still photography, so she double majored in both. She would go on to earn her master's degree in cinematography from AFI Conservatory in 2006. She entered the ranks of professional cinematographers with a job shooting on the reality series ""The Hills"" (MTV, 2006-2010). It was far from the substantial and artistically minded films Morrison had in mind, but the experience did teach her how to light for multiple cameras at once-a very useful skill in the realm of independent film. She would go on to shoot Zal Batmanglij's independent science fiction film ""Sound of My Voice"" (2011) and Ryan Coogler's ""Fruitvale Station"" (2013). Coogler offered her the director of photography position on ""Creed' (2015), but Morrison was forced to turn the job down as she was pregnant at the time, and due to give birth in the middle of filming. She went on to shoot the Jennifer Aniston drama ""Cake"" (2014), the acclaimed ""Dope"" (2015), and the period drama ""Mudbound"" (2017) before reteaming with Coogler for what would prove a first for both of them: the Marvel blockbuster ""Black Panther"" (2018). Though neither had made such a high budget movie before, the pair brought their independent sensibilities to the project with great results, as the movie proved one of the highest grossing films of the decade. Fresh off of the film's success, Morrison signed on to shoot the period biopic ""Against All Enemies"" (2019)."

Born in the South Gyeongsang Province of South Korea in 1967, Song graduated from Busan Kyungsang College with a broadcasting degree before switching his attention to acting and joining Kee Kuk-seo's influential improvisational-based theatre company. Initially focusing on stage work, Song eventually made his first notable on-screen appearance in the crime drama ""Green Fish"" (1997) before stealing the show as a gangster who trains a group of young recruits in mafia thriller ""No. 3"" (1997). Following small parts in ""Bad Movie"" (1997), a quasi-documentary about the violent lives of delinquent teenagers in Seoul, and ""The Quiet Family"" (1998), a comedy horror about a family whose hunting lodge becomes a death trap, Song appeared as secret agent Jang-gil Lee in an homage to the '80s Hollywood blockbuster, ""Swiri"" (1999), and landed his first lead role as an inept bank clerk-turned-professional wrestler in ""The Foul King"" (2000). From then on, Song became one of the most bankable and acclaimed Korean actors of his generation, with performances as a revenge-fuelled business executive in ""Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance"" (2002) and a lovestruck baseball pitcher in romantic comedy ""YMCA Baseball Team"" (2002) showcasing his versatility. Roles as a North Korean sergeant in ""J.S.A. Joint Security Area"" (2000) and incompetent detective Park Doo-Man in ""Memories Of Murder"" (2003) attracted awards attention. After playing the titular character in ""The President's Barber"" (2004) and Choi Do-hyung, the leader of an expedition to the pole of inaccessibility in psychological thriller ""Antarctic Journal"" (2006), Song achieved international fame as the head of the dysfunctional family that's tormented by a sea monster in Bong Joon-ho's box-office smash, ""The Host"" (2006) and returned to the gangster genre as the retired mobster Kang In-goo in ""The Show Must Go On"" (2007).

After playing an NIS agent who falls from grace in North/South Korea spy thriller ""Secret Reunion"" (2010) and a retired gangster who has a hit taken out on him in ""Hindsight"" (2011), Song mixed with the Hollywood elite for the first time as drug-addicted designer Namgoong Minsu in the dystopian sci-fi adventure ""Snowpiercer"" (2013).

127,Bong Joon Ho,9/14/1969,"Daegu, South Korea",https://resizing.flixster.com/mFLUG73fi_gJDyuUa-RGuIJtYTo=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/325293_v9_bb.jpg,"One of South Korea's most acclaimed 21st century film-makers, writer, producer and director Bong Joon-ho broke box-office records in his homeland with crime drama ""Memories of Murder"" (2003) and monster movie ""The Host"" (2006) before making his mark on English-language cinema with the spectacular sci-fi fantasy ""Snowpiercer"" (2013). Born in Daegu, South Korea in 1969, Bong grew up in an artistic family where he immersed himself in the films of Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Shohei Imamura and after studying for a sociology degree at Yonsei University, attended a two-year course at the Korean Academy of Film Arts. Following his graduation, he received a screenplay credit on the omnibus film ""Seven Reasons Why Beer Is Better Than A Lover"" (1996), served as assistant director on the intimate four-part drama ""Motel Cactus"" (1997) and co-wrote action thriller ""Phantom: The Submarine"" (1999). Having previously honed his craft on short films ""White Man"" (1994), ""Memories In My Frame"" (1994) and ""Ji-ri-myeol-lyeol"" (1994), Bong eventually made his feature-length directorial debut with the self-penned ""Barking Dogs Never Bite"" (2000), a dark comedy about a university lecturer who abducts a neighbor's pet, which became a slow-burning word-of-mouth success. Adapted from Kim Kwang-rim's stage play about a real-life elusive serial killer who terrorised a rural town in the 1980s, ""Memories of Murder"" (2003) saw Bong write and direct the biggest Korean box-office draw of the year, with its success later credited as saving one of its production companies, Sidus Pictures, from bankruptcy. Bong then contributed to the 20-part omnibus film ""Twentidentity"" (2003) with ""Sink and Rise,"" a precursor to his next feature-length effort set alongside the Han River, and the ""Digital Short Films By Three Directors"" (2004) series with ""Influenza,"" a half-hour tale of a desperate man's descent into violent crime shot entirely on CCTV. After adding to his list of screenwriting credits with ""Antarctic Journal"" (2005), a psychological thriller about an expedition to reach the pole of inaccessibility, Bong achieved his international breakthrough with ""The Host"" (2006), a relatively big-budget blockbuster about a monster which wreaks havoc on a dysfunctional family that also became the highest-grossing film in South Korean history. Bong then added actor to his list of many talents with a small part as a teacher in socially-awkward comedy ""Crush and Blush"" (2008) and joined Michel Gondry and Leos Carax as director in the ""Tokyo!"" (2008) triptych with ""Shaking Tokyo,"" the heartwarming story of a recluse who falls in love with a pizza delivery girl. Bong's next full-length effort, ""Mother"" (2009), a gripping forensic-procedural drama based on a doting mother's struggle to prove her murder suspect son's innocence, was in a different style from its predecessors but still attracted Korean audiences in droves. Following a cameo in sci-fi anthology ""Doomsday Book"" (2012), Bong embraced English-language cinema for the first time with the post-apocalyptic fantasy ""Snowpiercer"" (2013), an adaptation of French graphic novel Le Transperceneige, for which he garnered near universal acclaim for his typically boundary-pushing style."

If he did not believe he was acting, it was certainly reflected in his seamless skills, which were full of natural, physical expressiveness. After making himself known as the drug-addicted antihero of ""Less Than Zero"" (1987), Downey delivered an uncanny portrayal of beloved silent film star ""Chaplin"" (1992), which earned him some of the highest praise of his career. But his gift had always been to transform a regular person into a creatively-detailed and thoroughly engrossing star of the show, often complete with memorable quirks. Even in his early roles in teen comedies, Downey stood out above his Brat Pack peers for his spontaneous energy and apparent fearlessness in exposing his very fragile inner workings. Though he made headlines for his manic portrayal of a tabloid TV journalist in ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994) and a gay book editor in ""Wonder Boys"" (2000), Downey unfortunately became more famous for his longtime drug addictions and numerous run-ins with the law. He eventually emerged from almost certain tragedy by attaining sobriety and re-launching his flagging career with a blockbuster starring turn in the hit ""Iron Man"" (2008), while earning laughs as a chameleon-like actor in ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), which only confirmed that the public loved a good comeback story as well as appreciated Downey's incredibly likeable presence on the big screen. Continuing his role as Iron Man throughout the series of Marvel Cinematic Universe films, including the blockbuster hit ""The Avengers"" (2012) and its sequels, Downey also starred in films ranging from ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) to familial legal drama ""The Judge"" (2014). In 2019, he would appear again as Tony Stark in ""Avengers: Endgame,"" reported to be the conclusion to the story of the original Avengers team. He also filmed a starring role in ""The Voyage of Dr. Dolittle"" (2020), and, through his banner Team Downey, was producing a remake of ""Perry Mason"" for HBO."
139,Chris Evans,6/13/1981,"Boston, Massachusetts, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/DTd0lUQGJjtaYnxuTb-F61F5iUs=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/173489_v9_ba.jpg,"Actor Chris Evans began his acting career in typical fashion, but it was his rapid rise to stardom which was unusual. Bitten by the acting bug in the first grade, Evans started out appearing in school plays and theater camp; from there it was a quick jump to local community theater, and later, an internship for a casting office. Once Evans made friends with a few agents on the job, it was a straight shot to television and blockbuster features. One of the more talented of the fair-haired, pretty-boy actors to emerge in the early years of the new millennium, Evans scored with roles in a succession of high-profile releases. His breakthrough came in 2005 when he was tapped to play the role of the Human Torch in director Tim Story's adaptation of the Marvel Comics classic ""The Fantastic Four"" and its subsequent sequel, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (2007). By the time he starred in ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" (2010) and as Captain America, one of the central pillars of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in films including ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011), ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), Evans was a star assured of accomplishing even greater things. Simultaneously, his work starring in and directing romantic drama ""Before We Go"" (2014) and starring in family drama ""Gifted"" (2017) showed off his non-superhero range."
140,Mark Ruffalo,11/22/1967,"Kenosha, Wisconsin, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/g-5e0iXBQGMYZ3KyTpvKQD-mlQw=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/43389_v9_bc.jpg,"Like many other actors who were tagged ""best of a generation,"" Mark Ruffalo's roots were in theater and independent film where his honest, open character approach was applauded. His breakout stage role in Kenneth Lonergan's acclaimed ""This Is Our Youth"" led Lonergan to give Ruffalo the lead in his film directorial debut ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000), which earned countless festival awards and had critics buzzing about the little-known actor's subtle, compelling performance as a cerebral but aimless young adult with an arrest record and a pregnant teenage girlfriend. Hollywood came courting, but struggled with a tidy niche in which to put the darkly handsome actor; first offering him small but effective character roles as ""conflicted"" types in big budget thrillers like ""Collateral"" (2004) before unsuccessfully making the understated actor into a bland leading man in romantic comedies like ""Just Like Heaven"" (2005). Ruffalo eventually found an appropriate arena somewhere between the multiplex and the art house, favored by character-driven directors like Jane Campion, David Fincher, Steven Zaillian and eventually Martin Scorsese - all of whom capitalized on the actor's talent for believably disappearing into complex, empathetic characters."
141,Chris Hemsworth,8/11/1983,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",https://resizing.flixster.com/UJT2tDi_yWK_nXrpFIUWWLbniJI=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/528854_v9_bb.jpg,"Tall, muscular and exceptionally handsome, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth became a star in the U.S. with a series of well-received genre films. He was a household name in his native country while starring on the popular drama series, ""Home and Away"" (7 Network, 1988- ), playing an opinionated student navigating his way through high school in a seaside town. He quickly became a sci-fi sensation across the pond with a brief but memorable role in the J.J. Abrams reboot of the worldwide phenomenon ""Star Trek"" (2009) as Capt. James T. Kirk's ill-fated father. But it was not until he landed the lead role in the film version of the comic book hero ""Thor"" (2011) - beating out his younger brother, fellow heartthrob Liam, in the process - that Hemsworth truly flexed his muscles, establishing himself as one of the most charismatic young actors of the moment. Lionsgate films quickly capitalized on Hemsworth's popularity by releasing the long-delayed horror feature ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012), co-written by Joss Whedon. Ironically, it was Whedon who later directed the young star in the superhero blockbuster ""The Avengers"" (2012), bringing together ""Thor"" and Marvel Studios' other franchise films. Along with his continuing screen presence as the Nordic superhero, Hemsworth expanded with range with films ranging from the thriller ""Blackhat"" (2015), Ron Howard's sailing drama ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (2015), and two fantasy films based on fairy tales, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016). As talented as he was attractive, Hemsworth was without a doubt, a leading man to watch."

A native of Manhattan, she began studying acting as a child and made her screen debut at the age of nine in ""North"" (1994). The actress played the daughter of John Ritter in the Rob Reiner comedy. Similarly, she was cast as Sean Connery's daughter in the drama ""Just Cause"" (1995). The actress earned her first starring role playing opposite Aleksa Palladino in ""Manny & Lo"" (1996) about a pair of sisters running away from foster care. She was featured in director Eric Schaeffer's ""If Lucy Fell"" (1996) and ""Fall"" (1997). She had roles as well in the broad comedy ""Home Alone 3"" (1997) and Robert Redford's ""The Horse Whisperer"" (1998). Johansson began establishing her indie credentials when she teamed with Thora Birch for Terry Zwigoff's dark comedy ""Ghost World"" (2001). After a supporting role in the action comedy ""Eight Legged Freaks"" (2002), the actress began her march towards stardom in earnest. Director Sofia Coppola cast her as the disillusioned young woman who hangs out with Bill Murray's jaded actor during a trip to Tokyo in ""Lost in Translation"" (2003). She followed with a role as the muse to Colin Firth's Johannes Vermeer in ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" (2003). The following year she starred with future ""Avengers"" co-star Chris Evans in ""The Perfect Score"" (2004) and teamed with John Travolta in ""A Love Song for Bobby Long"" (2004). She would add roles opposite Helen Hunt in ""A Good Woman"" (2004) and as Dennis Quaid's daughter in ""In Good Company"" (2004). Woody Allen cast the actress as the lead in his ""Match Point"" (2005), and Michael Bay did likewise for his thriller ""The Island"" (2005). She would work with Allen again when he cast her alongside Hugh Jackman as a journalism student investigating a serial killer. She continued to work at an impressive clip, starring in ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006), ""The Prestige"" (2006), ""The Nanny Diaries"" (2007), and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (2008) in succession. Allen again used the actress, this time partnered with Rebecca Hall and Javier Bardem for ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" (2008). The actress also began mixing in Broadway performances, earning a Tony for her role opposite Liev Schreiber in ""A View from the Bridge."" She went from drama to blockbuster, though, when she agreed to play former assassin Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Johansson made her debut as the character in the Robert Downey Jr. vehicle ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and brought the character to fruition fully in ""The Avengers."" Outside of the superhero world, she starred with Matt Damon in ""We Bought a Zoo"" (2011) and portrayed actress Janet Leigh in ""Hitchcock"" (2012). Actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt cast her in his directorial debut ""Don Jon"" (2013). Even though she didn't appear on screen, Johansson gained notice for voicing a virtual assistant that Joaquin Phoenix forms an unhealthy bond with in Spike Jonze's ""Her"" (2013). She continued her trend of working with strong directors when she co-starred in Jon Favreau's ""Chef"" (2014). The Marvel world soon beckoned, however, and she returned to playing Black Widow for ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015). Having proven her physical prowess in the superhero films, she starred as a genetically altered woman in Luc Besson's thriller ""Lucy"" (2014). She would later join the ensemble cast of the Coen Brothers' Hollywood comedy ""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016) and starred in the live-action remake of the anime classic ""Ghost in the Shell"" (2017). She also starred with Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer in the comedy ""Rough Night"" (2017). Her run as Black Widow reached a whole new level with ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). The three films would combine to take in more than $5-billion dollars at the box office worldwide. She gained positive reviews for her role opposite Adam Driver in ""Marriage Story"" (2019) playing an actress going through a divorce. She also appeared in Taika Waititi's inventive ""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019). After appearing as Natasha Romanoff alongside a variety of other superheroes, Johansson's character was finally given a stand-alone film with ""Black Widow"" (2020)."

With no qualms about taking a turn to the dark side, Renner added to his esteem with acclaimed indie turns as a white supremacist in ""Neo Ned"" (2005) and a sexist boss in ""North Country"" (2005). He tackled more complex roles with sterling performances as a former L.A.P.D. cop in ""S.W.A.T."" (2003) and as the intimidating Wood Hite, cousin to Frank and Jesse James, in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007). Though a recognizable face, Renner finally broke through as a household name following his critically lauded turn as an on-edge bomb disposal expert operating in the Oscar-winning Iraq War thriller, ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009). From there, he earned himself an Oscar nomination with a finely tuned turn as a career criminal in Ben Affleck's widely hailed crime drama, ""The Town"" (2010), which soon led to roles in blockbuster movies like ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), ""The Avengers"" (2011) and ""The Bourne Legacy"" (2012). With each critical nod, Renner secured a firmer footing in Hollywood as a recognizable and dependable face in a variety of feature films."

She made the transition from child star to grown-up actress smoothly, earning acclaim for her turns in such movies as ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" (2010) and ""21 Jump Street"" (2012) and impressed critics with her nuanced turn as Toni Collette's self-destructive daughter on ""The United States of Tara"" (Showtime, 2009-2011). Critics dubbed her the ""It"" girl of SXSW 2013 for her flurry of high-profile projects, particularly her raved-about, star-making lead role in the drama ""Short Term 12"" (2013), which earned her serious award buzz. Two years later, she exceeded those expectations with a subtle performance in the indie drama ""Room"" (2015), which garnered widespread critical acclaim and a Best Actress Oscar. One of the rare talents who only improved with age, Brie Larson gave critics and fans ample reason to expect her to reach even greater artistic heights over time, even as she also tackled roles in escapist fare like ""Kong: Skull island"" (2017) and joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as superhero Carol Danvers in ""Captain Marvel"" (2019)."

While he became vaguely recognizable thanks to several prominent film and television roles - namely as Alicia Silverstone's know-it-all stepbrother in ""Clueless"" (1995), Phoebe's husband on ""Friends"" (NBC, 1994-2004), and Jennifer Aniston's gay best friend in the romantic comedy ""The Object of My Affection"" (1998) - Rudd eventually rode the Judd Apatow wave to stardom with a series of surprisingly successful comedies in which he was more often than not, the primary scene-stealer. His roles in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005), ""Knocked Up"" (2007), ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008), ""Role Models"" (2008) and ""I Love You, Man"" (2009) established the versatile actor, who oscillated easily between comedy and drama both on screen and on stage, as a bona fide box-office force and a rising star. Because of his raised profile, Rudd was able to take bigger risks in less mainstream projects, as he did for ""Dinner for Schmucks"" (2010) and ""Our Idiot Brother"" (2011). He took a step back with a leading role in James L. Brooks' critically maligned romantic comedy ""How Do You Know"" (2010) and stepped into a producer's role for the low-budget ""Wanderlust"" (2011), and later became an unlikely superhero in the Marvel hit ""Ant-Man"" (2015). But regardless of his projects' success or lack thereof, moviegoers held great reserves of goodwill for the actor. No matter how big or small the project, Rudd became one of Hollywood's most popular and marketable stars."

After years of thankless guest appearances on TV dramas and sitcoms, Cheadle gained attention with the role of the fastidious hotel manager of ""The Golden Palace"" (CBS, 1992-93), a spin-off from the beloved sitcom, ""The Golden Girls"" (CBS, 1985-1992). The chameleon-like Cheadle broke out with an acclaimed performance in Carl Franklin's crime thriller ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" (1995) and continued the streak with remarkable work in highly-lauded films like ""Boogie Nights"" (1997) and ""Out of Sight"" (1998). He officially made Hollywood's A-list as one of Danny Ocean's crack team of con men in Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001), but it was his performance as real-life hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina in ""Hotel Rwanda"" (2004) that earned Cheadle the most effusive critical praise of his career. He played an integral role in the Oscar-winning ensemble drama ""Crash"" (2005) prior to turning in a tour de force performance in the radio DJ biopic ""Talk to Me"" (2007). In addition to the hugely successful sequels to ""Ocean's Eleven,"" the actor was frequently seen in such big-budget productions as the superhero blockbuster sequel ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and related films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016). He later returned to television as the star of the highly-regarded cable comedy ""House of Lies"" (Showtime, 2012-16) and made his feature directing debut with the impressionistic biopic ""Miles Ahead"" (2016), in which he also starred as mercurial jazz icon Miles Davis. Cheadle's ability to virtually disappear into any role kept him at the very top of Hollywood's list of ""go to"" actors."

Born on November 28, 1987 in Inverness, Scotland, Gillan embarked on her career when she was 16, moving to Edinburgh to complete an HNC Acting and Performance course at Telford College. At 18, she moved to London to study at the prestigious Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. While at Italia Conti, Gillan began modeling as a way to earn extra money, and was cast in her first TV appearance, a cameo role on an episode of the final series of the police procedural ""Rebus"" (ITV, 2000-07). She then spent the next two years as a cast member of the sketch comedy series ""The Kevin Bishop Show"" (Channel 4, 2008-09), before making her film debut in the supernatural thriller ""Outcast"" (2010). Gillan's big break came when she landed the role of Amelia ""Amy"" Pond, the lovably quirky companion to Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor on the fifth series of the rebooted sci-fi classic ""Doctor Who."" The character quickly became a fan favorite, and Gillan would portray Amy on and off for the next three years. Following her stint as the Doctor's companion, Gillan began to pursue projects across the pond, starring in the horror film ""Oculus"" (2013), and taking on the role of Nebula, an evil half cyborg warrior in the quirky surprise hit ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). Around this time, Gillan decided that she wanted to branch out into writing and directing, beginning with the short film ""Coward"" (2015) while also appearing in Adam McKay's financial crisis drama ""The Big Short"" (2015), and Ti West's revisionist western ""In a Valley of Violence"" (2016). She went on to reprise the role of Nebula for the equally successful sequel ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017), while also co-starring with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black in another surprise hit, the family adventure film ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" (2017). Gillan followed up this highly successful year with the release of ""The Party's Just Beginning"" (2018), a full-length indie dramedy set in her home town of Inverness, which she wrote, directed, and co-starred in. In addition to this, Gillan portrayed Nebula for the third time in the superhero mega-hit ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018)."

After attracting attention for his likable role as Jennifer Garner's reporter friend on ""Alias"" (ABC, 2001-06), Cooper fearlessly made his first major big screen impression as the unlikable groom in ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005). He regained audience's affection in lesser fare like ""Failure to Launch"" (2006) and, in testament to his charisma, emerged unscathed from Sandra Bullock's notorious bomb ""All About Steve"" (2008). Cooper ensured his own launch with the lead in the critical and box office juggernaut ""The Hangover"" (2009) and proved an invaluable member of the romantic, dramatic ensemble ""He's Just Not That Into You"" (2009) and ""Valentine's Day"" (2010) casts. Graduating to full-fledged stardom with a flashy role in ""The A-Team"" (2010), Cooper continued to rise as a bankable, talented and very much in-demand movie star, which was confirmed with a return to box-office prominence with ""The Hangover Part II"" (2011) and his star turn in David O. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012) opposite Jennifer Lawrence. That trio reunited twice more for ""American Hustle"" (2013) and ""Joy"" (2015), while Cooper continued starring in films ranging from Clint Eastwood's drama ""American Sniper"" (2014) to James Gunn's blockbuster action-comedy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) and its 2017 sequel, in which he provided the voice of Rocket, a raccoon-like mutant with serious anger management issues. Whether starring in comedies, thrillers or romantic dramas - as well as making a tabloid splash in the wake of rumored romances with some of Hollywood's loveliest leading ladies - Cooper propelled himself into becoming one of Hollywood's most bankable stars."

Raised by Hollywood fixtures Bruce Paltrow, a successful director and producer, and renowned actress Blythe Danner, Gwyneth Paltrow was practically predestined toward a life of show business, despite a brief sojourn studying anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Paltrow made her acting debut at age 17 in the TV movie ""High"" (CBS 1989), directed by her father. The following year, Paltrow graced the stage at the Williamstown Theatre Festival, and one year later still she broke onto the big screen with the drama film ""Shout"" (1991), costarring John Travolta, and Steven Spielberg's reimagining of the Peter Pan story, ""Hook"" (1991). Before long, Paltrow was starring in hit features like David Fincher's thriller ""Se7en"" (1995), the Jane Austen adaptation ""Emma"" (1996), the eventual Best Picture-winning romance ""Shakespeare in Love"" (1998), for which Paltrow herself won an Oscar for Best Actress, and the revered psychological thriller ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999). Throughout this period, Paltrow dated fellow rising stars Brad Pitt and Ben Affleck. The 2000s brought Paltrow to more offbeat fare, such as Wes Anderson's ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), the action-adventure movie ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (2004), and the drama ""Proof"" (2005). In 2008, she signed onto what would become the beginnings of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing Pepper Potts in ""Iron Man"" (2008). Around the same time, Paltrow launched a lifestyle newsletter (later turned website) called Goop. Paltrow reprised the role in ""Iron Man 2"" (2010), ""The Avengers"" (2012), and ""Iron Man 3"" (2013), all the while playing a recurring role on Ryan Murphy's hit musical dramedy series ""Glee"" (Fox 2009-2015). Going forward, Paltrow starred predominantly in Marvel films. In 2017, Paltrow lent her voice to the array of allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. In 2018, Paltrow married Brad Falchuk; the following year, she appeared in the series ""The Politician"" (Netflix 2019-), which he produced with Ryan Murphy."

Favreau parlayed his rising profile into a number of supporting big-screen roles as cynical side men, but he was more anxious to get behind the camera and direct bigger features. After another indie buddy comedy with Vaughn, mob farce ""Made"" (2001), Favreau went wide with the holiday hit ""Elf"" (2003), starring a spandex-clad Will Ferrell. His acclaimed adaptation of the kids book ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) missed the mark with audiences, but his 2008 adaptation of Marvel Comics' ""Iron Man"" starring Robert Downey, Jr. was one of the most anticipated action films of the year, leading to a return to leading man status for Downey, Jr. and hard-won blockbuster credentials for its highly creative director. Along with continuing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a producer and actor (playing Tony Stark's personal assistant Happy Hogan), Favreau found further success as a director through films as varied as the romantic comedy-drama ""Chef"" (2014) and the CGI blockbusters ""The Jungle Book"" (2016) and ""The Lion King"" (2019)."

Born Tessa Lynn Thompson on October 3, 1983 in Los Angeles, California, she hailed from a musical family - her father was Marc Anthony Thompson, founder of the neo-soul collective Chocolate Genius, Inc., and her maternal grandfather was rumba bandleader and television host Bobby Ramos - and divided her childhood between Los Angeles and New York City. She began acting as a student at Santa Monica High School, and focused on a degree in cultural anthropology at Santa Monica College while continuing to perform on stages across Los Angeles. These included a 2005 performance in ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the Boston Court Theatre in Pasadena that earned an NAACP theater nomination. That same year, Thompson made her screen acting debut in an episode of the CBS crime drama ""Cold Case,"" which was soon followed by series regular work in the second season of ""Veronica Mars"" (UPN/CW, 2004-07) as Jackie Cook, a potential love interest for Percy Daggs III's crime-solving Wallace Fennell.

Jordan's independent-minded love interest in ""Creed"" (2015), and as Delos Board member Charlotte Hale on HBO's ""Westworld"" (2016- ).The following year, Thompson was seen by millions in Marvel Studios' ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017), playing a flinty slave trader who imprisons and later befriends Chris Hemsworth's God of Thunder.

Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe bockbuster ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). Born in St. Louis, Missouri on August 5, 1970, Gunn was raised in a large Irish Catholic family in the suburb of Manchester. As a child, he struggled to connect with his peers, but found solace in a huge comic book collection purchased for him by his father. From there, he began experimenting with Super 8 movies, which allowed him to experiment with early efforts in the horror genre. He briefly attended college but dropped out to play in a rock band. He also briefly supported himself as a hospital orderly in Tucson, Arizona while also writing and drawing comic strips for underground publications. Gunn completed his bachelor's degree at St. Louis University and headed for New York, where he received an MFA in creative writing from Columbia University. While there, he penned his first novel, The Toy Collector (1999), while also exploring the world of low-budget filmmaking with the New York-based exploitation production company Troma Entertainment. Initially hired as an intern, Gunn was quickly promoted to write and co-direct one of the company's most substantial hits, the raunchy spoof ""Tromeo and Juliet"" (1996). In 2000, he relocated to Los Angeles to write and produce ""The Specials"" (2000), a superhero comedy with Rob Lowe, Thomas Haden Church and Judy Greer that became a minor cult hit on home video. Gunn scored his first major hit with the script for a live-action film version of ""Scooby-Doo"" (2002), starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini, and Matthew Lillard as the Mystery Machine team. This surprise hit was soon followed by a sequel, ""Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed"" (2004) and the script for director Zach Snyder's remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004). The success of both films made Gunn the first screenwriter to land two projects at the top of the box office in consecutive weeks. Gunn made his feature directorial debut with ""Slither"" (2006), a wry science fiction comedy that received critical acclaim but only modest box office returns. He then ventured into television, directing several pilots for Xbox Live as well as a short-form web series called ""PG Porn"" (2008-09) which parodied adult film tropes. After helming the dark superhero comedy ""Super"" (2009), Gunn scored his first major hit as director and writer with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) a tongue-in-cheek live action take on a lesser-known title from the Marvel Comics stable starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. The film scored big numbers at the box office, as well as near-unanimous critical praise for Gunn's reverential but tongue-in-cheek take on comic book space operas. The sequel, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017) was also a hit. In the midst of planning for the third film in the series, an online alt-right conspiracy theorist named Michael Cernovich, upset at Gunn's increasingly vocal criticism of Donald Trump, resurfaced a number of Gunn's old tweets from 2009 that included deliberately shocking and vulgar jokes about pedophilia and other taboos. In the ensuing uproar, Gunn was fired from directing ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" and relieved of his other duties in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, unlike in many other cases of Hollywood personalities losing jobs because of social media protests, there was a backlash against Disney/Marvel's quick decision, with many supporters pointing out that Cernovich himself had tweeted in support of raping women in the past. On July 30, 2018, a statement in support of Gunn was signed by the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" cast, including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel and Dave Bautista."

Following his journeyman years composing music for a number of television series in the late-1970s, Silvestri began his movie career proper with ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), the first in a series of ongoing collaborations with director-producer Robert Zemeckis. Teaming with the filmmaker on each of his consecutive projects from there on out, including the smash hits ""Back to the Future"" (1985) and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988), the prolific composer also lent his talents to other directors on films like ""The Abyss"" (1989) and ""The Bodyguard"" (1992). Silvestri continued to add resonance to more Zemeckis projects, including a trio of memorable Tom Hanks vehicles - ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), ""Cast Away"" (2000) and ""The Polar Express"" (2004), the latter of which earned him a Grammy Award. Revered for his sweeping scores of heroic proportions, it came as little surprise when the composer was tapped to provide pulse-pounding soundtracks to the superhero blockbusters ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) and ""The Avengers"" (2012). Known as one of the fastest, hardest working and most congenial composer-conductors in Hollywood, it was no wonder Silvestri had long held the position of ""go-to guy"" when it came to providing the appropriate score for movies of virtually every genre."

After making his transition from the stages of New York to the studios of Hollywood with the crime drama ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936), Bogart endured an extended period playing second banana to more established stars, such as Edward G. Robinson in films like ""Bullets or Ballots"" (1936). Although productions like ""They Drive by Night"" (1940) and ""High Sierra"" (1941) gradually increased his Hollywood standing, it was Bogart's turn as private eye Sam Spade in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) that first gave audiences a taste of the world-weary cynical, yet moralistic hero he would become so closely associated with. The persona was further cemented with his performances in ""Casablanca"" (1942) and ""The Big Sleep"" (1946), with the former hailed by many as one of the greatest films ever made. In between these cinematic milestones he met his co-star and future wife, actress Lauren Bacall, with whom he would appear in a total of four hit films. Other important films in Bogart's remarkable career included ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948), ""Key Largo"" (1948), ""The African Queen"" (1951) - for which he would win his only Academy Award - and ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954). Brought down by cancer while still at the height of his creative powers, Bogart would be remembered as an unrepentant iconoclast, irrepressible rabble rouser, and a true American cultural treasure."

Either way, she had few peers when it came to expressing the subtleties of romantic tension. In 1933, fresh out of high school, she enrolled in the Royal Dramatic Theater and made her film debut the following year, soon becoming Sweden's most promising young actress. Her breakthrough film was Gustaf Molander's ""Intermezzo"" (1936), in which she played a pianist who has a love affair with a celebrated--and married--violinist. The film garnered the attention of American producer David O. Selznick, who invited her to Hollywood to do a remake. In 1939 she co-starred with Leslie Howard in that film, which the public loved, leading to a seven-year contract with Selznick.  Selznick promoted Bergman's wholesomeness from the beginning. He loaned her to other studios for ""Adam Had Four Sons,"" ""Rage in Heaven"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (all 1941). She then starred with Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"" (1942), perhaps her most popular film, and was also featured with Gary Cooper in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943)."" She won her first Oscar for her portrayal of a wife nearly driven mad by Charles Boyer in ""Gaslight"" (1944). The following year, Bergman had starring roles in ""Saratoga Trunk,"" as a psychiatrist opposite Gregory Peck in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Spellbound,"" and as a nun opposite Bing Crosby's priest in ""The Bells of St. Mary's."" Bergman's last picture under contract to Selznick, and probably her finest work, was Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946), an emotionally complex espionage film in which she played a woman bent on self-destruction until redeemed by the love of a federal agent, played by Cary Grant. Bergman then went freelance, first playing a prostitute in ""Arch of Triumph"" and then the contrasting ""Joan of Arc"" (both 1948), a role she had played to great acclaim on Broadway in 1946. Her final film for Hitchcock was the 1949 period piece ""Under Capricorn."" Bergman then spent some years away from Hollywood following the dissolution of her marriage to her first husband and her subsequent remarriage to Italian director Roberto Rossellini. She made a triumphant return to Hollywood with ""Anastasia"" (1956), for which she won her second Oscar. Bergman also began branching out into TV and stage roles. She gave a delightful performance in the adaptation of the Broadway comedy ""Cactus Flower"" (1967). She received a third Academy Award for her supporting role in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (1974) and won acclaim for her co-starring role with Liv Ullmann in Ingmar Bergman's ""Autumn Sonata"" (1978), an intense drama about a pianist and her daughter. Bergman's health began to fail in the late 1970s, though she fought off cancer long enough to complete the TV movie ""A Woman Called Golda"" (1982), in which she portrayed Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir. The performance earned her an Emmy, her final honor."

After another starring turn in ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" (1935), Rains assiduously avoided being typecast in horror films by appearing in the musical ""Hearts Divided"" (1936), the costume drama ""Anthony Adverse,"" and the romantic drama ""Stolen Holiday"" (1937), the last being the first of nine films he made with director Michael Curtiz. He went on to co-star in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938) and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939), before delivering his most iconic performance as the cheerful, but corrupt French police captain  Renault in the mother of all classic movies, ""Casablanca"" (1942). From there, he appeared in a number of acclaimed films like ""Now, Voyager"" (1942), ""Passage to Marseille"" (1944), and ""Mr. Skeffington"" (1944), before delivering another iconic performance as the wanted leader of an underground Nazi movement in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946), which earned the actor his fourth Academy Award nomination. Though he appeared in movies of diminishing quality, he ended his career on a high note with major supporting parts in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (1965), underscoring for Rains a career as one of Hollywood's most popular character actors."

Amidst the turmoil of World War I, Veidt trained with the renowned Max Reinhardt at the Deutches Theater in Berlin, where he grew from bit player to prominent leading man. With his mesmerizing portrayal of the sleepwalking killer in ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1920), Veidt achieved true lasting stardom as he continued to work with the greatest directors of the day, including Robert Wiene and F.W. Murnau. John Barrymore lured him out to Hollywood for ""The Beloved Rogue"" (1927) and director Paul Leni gave him one of his most iconic roles in ""The Man Who Laughs"" (1928), before the advent of sound prompted the German-speaking actor to return home. Soon, however, the rise of Nazism led Veidt and his Jewish wife to immigrate to England, where he mastered the language and continued his success in such works as ""I Was a Spy"" (1932) and ""Dark Journey"" (1937). Having relocated to Hollywood after the Blitz of London, the actor continued to work throughout the war, most memorably as the icy Nazi, Major Strasser in ""Casablanca"" (1942). Remembered for roles at each end of his professional timeline, Veidt maintained a prolific career in both theater and film on three continents for more than 25 years."

After making his English language debut for Alfred Hitchcock in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1934), Lorre was lured to Hollywood with the promise of a studio contract. Warehoused for a year by Columbia Pictures, Lorre was loaned out to play more maniacs in ""Mad Love"" (1935) and ""Stranger on the Third Floor"" (1940). Against the better judgment of the Warner Brothers front office, first time filmmaker John Huston took a chance on Lorre by casting him as the villainous Joel Cairo to Humphrey Bogart's steely shamus Sam Spade in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941). Lorre and Bogart became frequent co-stars in such World War II era fare as ""Across the Pacific"" (1941), ""Casablanca"" (1942) and ""Passage to Marseilles"" (1944). Despite playing the occasional heroic role, Lorre remained typecast as misfits and miscreants. Plagued by ill health and drug addiction, Lorre capped his career with a run of tongue-in-cheek horror films, including ""The Raven"" (1963) and ""Comedy of Terrors"" (1963) with horror kings Boris Karloff and Vincent Price. Dead at 59, Lorre's legacy survived him, due to his roles in iconic Bogart films and the devotion of horror film fans who echoed the late actor's designation as The Lord High Minister of All That is Sinister."

While Wilson's loyal piano player only appeared in a few scenes, the actor brought considerable personality to his role and in a film filled with rich characters and vivid actors, he managed to leave a lasting impression. The African-American drummer and singer began his career in minstrel shows and toured overseas with his own band before returning to American and launching into an acting career. Various forays on the stage and in a movie designed for the African-American theater circuit did not result in any significant notoriety coming his way until he was added to the cast of the Broadway success ""Cabin in the Sky"" (1940-41), where his performance as ""Little Joe"" led to a movie contract. However, most of his parts were of the small and stereotypical variety endured by most black performers until ""Casablanca"" (1942) earned him a place in film history. Wilson had more successes here and there, notably the lavish musical fantasy extravaganza ""Stormy Weather"" (1943) and the Broadway hit ""Bloomer Girl"" (1944-46), but his performance as Sam and his rendition of ""As Time Goes By"" became as indelibly linked to that beloved feature as ""Here's looking at you, kid"" and ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."""

When a publicity shot of the film star was distributed by the Third Reich's propaganda machine as an example of ""The Typical Jew,"" Dalio fled Europe for the United States, taking stereotypical roles as a Frenchman in American-made films. While Dalio's brief stint in Hollywood was better remembered for the high caliber of stars he appeared with -- Edward G. Robinson in ""Unholy Partners"" (1941), Glenn Ford in ""Flight Lieutenant"" (1942), and, perhaps most memorably, Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"" (1942) -- the actor persevered in the immediate postwar years, earning more substantial parts in comedic romps such as ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953) and the Audrey Hepburn-starred ""Sabrina"" (1954).

Tirelessly hammering out four or five films a year, Curtiz relentlessly tackled both low-budget pictures and more prestigious Oscar-baiting fare, all the while proving amazingly adept at creating lavish results on minimal budgets in a wide variety of genres. His most famous player, Errol Flynn, appeared in 12 films for him, including swashbuckler classics like ""Captain Blood"" (1935) and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). Curtiz had a knack for detecting and fostering unknown talents, including Flynn, John Garfield - whom he introduced in ""Four Daughters"" (1938) - and Doris Day, among others. His highly developed visual approach combined with his technical mastery could elevate the most mundane material, and three of his finest films - ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" (1942), ""Casablanca"" (1942) and ""Mildred Pierce"" (1945) - made a virtue of melodrama and sentimentality. Though he reached the culmination of his creative powers with ""The Breaking Point"" (1950), Curtiz entered a financially successful period with more crowd-pleasing pictures like ""White Christmas"" (1954) and ""King Creole"" (1958).  Having tapped out with ""The Commancheros"" (1961), Curtiz was nonetheless a tireless director who left behind a rich legacy, some of which displayed the very best Hollywood had to offer."

However, who did what on it has always been a contentious affair. Koch and Robinson have always downplayed the involvement of the Epsteins, claiming that the brothers wrote only the comedy and police bits, while they handled, respectively, the political and romance angles. The Epsteins always maintained their authorship. No matter the real story, the brothers were deservedly honored (along with Koch) with Oscars for their work. Before and after ""Casablanca,"" the New York City-raised Epsteins were experts at turning plays into movies, and they were also successful script doctors. Together, they wrote a number of hit films, including the tearjerkers ""Four Wives"" and ""Mr. Skeffington"" and the comedies ""The Strawberry Blonde,"" ""No Time for Comedy,"" ""The Man Who Came to Dinner,"" and ""Arsenic and Old Lace.""

Following years of over-the-top action and reality stretching plotlines, Craig helped to bring the Bond franchise back to its grittier espionage roots with the critically hailed ""Casino Royale"" (2006). Prior to his portrayal of Bond, Craig appeared in films like ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" (2001) and ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), before garnering attention as an unorthodox drug dealer in the British crime thriller ""Layer Cake"" (2004). From there, he earned more kudos for ""Enduring Love"" (2004) and struck fear as a single-minded Mossad assassin in ""Munich"" (2005). But it was ""Casino Royale"" that turned the rising star into an overnight sensation, though his later go-rounds as Bond - ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008), ""Skyfall"" (2012), and ""Spectre"" (2015) - were not always as well received. Meanwhile, Craig delivered strong performances outside the Bond universe in the World War II drama ""Defiance"" (2008) and the much-anticipated American adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (2011), while making celebrity news for his marriage to English actress Rachel Weisz in 2011. Regardless of the Bond role, Craig possessed the talent and presence that would have made him a star regardless."

She knew from a young age that her calling was to be a performer, and at age 12, she enrolled at the National Theater School of Cuba. After four years of study, de Armas appeared in her first film, 2006's ""Una rosa de Francia"" (2006). She would rack up a small handful of additional roles in her native Cuba before a family connection gave her a new opportunity. Her Spanish heritage through her grandparents gave de Armas dual citizenship with Spain, enabling her to circumvent Cuba's strict and often impossible process to secure an exit visa. In Spain, de Armas joined the casts of popular series like ""El internado"" (Antena 3 TelevisiÃ³n , 2007-2010) and ""Hispania, la leyenda"" (Antena 3 TelevisiÃ³n, 2010-12), and in films like the horror-comedy ""Faraday"" (2013) before setting her sights on Hollywood. de Armas was well aware that she would be starting over without any of the name recognition she'd built up in Cuba and Spain, but she still persevered, soon landing a role alongside Keanu Reeves in the Eli Roth directed thriller ""Knock Knock"" (2015). The very next year found her staring with Robert De Niro in the boxing film ""Hands of Stone."" After co-starring in Todd Phillips' Iraq War black comedy ""War Dogs"" (2016) and French-made action thriller ""Overdrive"" (2017), de Armas scored her highest-profile role to date in Denis Villeneuve's eagerly anticipated ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017)."
202,Jamie Lee Curtis,11/22/1958,"Los Angeles, California, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/rCN4gEmq3WqB3FPhiZ5GVtGSF_I=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/29426_v9_bb.jpg,"Actress and author Jamie Lee Curtis's screen career arced from early success as a heroine in peril in horror films like ""Halloween"" (1979) to critical praise and awards for brassy turns in comedies like ""Trading Places"" (1983) and ""A Fish Called Wanda"" (1988) and later, a fearless embrace of middle-aged and senior women with brio to spare in ""Freaky Friday"" (2003) and ""Halloween"" (2019). Born November 22, 1958 in Santa Monica, California, she was the daughter of two popular postwar Hollywood actors-Oscar nominee Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh-who divorced when she was four years of age. Though raised in a show business family, she initially showed little interest in following in her parents' footsteps, and focused on life at Westlake School and Beverly Hills High School, before graduating from Choate Rosemary Hall. She found those experiences emotionally draining due to her low self-confidence, and made it through a single semester at the University of the Pacific before dropping out to try her hand at acting. She made her television debut as a military nurse on the short-lived ""Operation Petticoat"" (ABC, 1977-79), a sitcom based on the 1960 comedy that starred her father, before segueing to guest roles on other series, including ""The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries"" (ABC, 1977-79). She was not the first choice to play the teenaged heroine of ""Halloween"" (1979), a low-budget horror film by USC grad John Carpenter, but her connection to Leigh, who had famously starred in Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960), helped to win her role; the film became a runaway success at the box office and launched not only an enduring film franchise but also the slasher film boom of the 1980s. For Curtis, it led to a string of starring roles in other horror films, including ""Halloween II"" (1981) and lesser efforts like ""Terror Train"" (1980), which minted her, for a time, as a scream queen. But Curtis broke free from the label on the strength of critically praised performances in the TV movie ""Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story"" (NBC, 1981) and a brassy, BAFTA-winning turn as an escort in John Landis' ""Trading Places"" (1983).  These successes led to Curtis moving up to leads in A-list features, though several of these early efforts - ""Perfect"" (1985), with Curtis as an aerobics instructor - did little more than showcase her dedication to her roles. She finally earned a project worthy of her talents with 1988's ""A Fish Called Wanda"" (1988), which cast her as a con artist who fell for her mark, a hapless barrister played by John Cleese, who also wrote the script. She continued to work in films but found greater success as the star of ""Anything But Love"" (ABC, 1989-1992), a wry office comedy with Curtis and Richard Lewis as co-workers who attempted to keep their romance under wraps. For her performance, Curtis earned a Golden Globe and People's Choice Award, and followed it with another Golden Globe nomination, this time for her starring role in a TNT adaptation of Wendy Wasserstein's play ""The Heidi Chronicles"" (1995) and a second Golden Globes win for playing undercover agent Arnold Schwarzenegger's mousy wife in James Cameron's Oscar-nominated ""True Lies"" (1994). After a string of minor box office successes - including a return to the ""Halloween"" franchise for ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" (1998) and ""Halloween: Resurrection"" (2002) -  and recovery from an addiction to painkillers and alcohol, Curtis scored another hit with a remake of ""Freaky Friday"" (2003), for which she and screen daughter Lindsay Lohan switched personalities. Subsequent efforts, however, failed to generate audience interest, and by 2006, she told interviewers that she had put her screen career on the backburner to concentrate on her family with comic actor-director Christopher Guest of ""This is Spinal Tap"" (1984) fame. Curtis had also established a popular second career as a children's author, beginning in 1993 with When I Was Little: A Four-Year-Old's Memoir of Her Youth (1993). It was soon followed by Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born (1996), which was inspired by the birth of her adopted daughter, Annie, and then earned a New York Times bestseller with Today I Feel Silly, and Other Moods That Make My Day (1998). Her literary career and a string of commercial appearances for a probiotic yogurt kept Curtis busy for much of the 2000s until 2012, when she signed on for a recurring role on ""NCIS"" (CBS, 2003- ). A stint on Ryan Murphy's self-referential horror series ""Scream Queens""  (FOX, 2015-16) preceded another return to her roots with ""Halloween"" (2019), which found Curtis's heroine, Laurie Strode, now a grandmother and survivalist with an arsenal waiting for franchise villain Michael Myers' inevitable return. A huge success due largely to Curtis's intensely physical performance, ""Halloween"" signaled the launch of an all-new franchise with Curtis at its head for two more films announced for 2020 and 2021. While serving as star and executive producer on these projects, Curtis also joined the ensemble cast of Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"" (2019), with Daniel Craig as an acerbic detective rooting out a killer from the ranks of a squabbling family that included Chris Evans, Toni Collette, and Michael Shannon."

Collette's strong first impression as a frumpy sad sack from Down Under was the first of a remarkably wide range of physical and psychological transformations the actress would become known for. International filmmakers sought Collette's gift for totally inhabiting characters. So convincing was her palette of international accents and so thorough were her physical metamorphoses that audiences often times did not realize they were watching the same actress in ""Velvet Goldmine"" (1998), ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999), ""About a Boy"" (2002) and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2006). Her unique gift for inhabiting a multitude of characters came to full fruition with her Emmy-winning role as a wife and mother with dissociative identity disorder on the Diablo Cody-scripted dramedy, ""The United States of Tara"" (Showtime, 2009- ). Unconcerned with stardom, Collette enjoyed creative freedom and made consistently interesting project choices that showcased her instinctive acting style, quick wit and significant depth."

After that, Johnson had the dream come true when he achieved massive success as Det. Sonny Crockett on Michael Mann's trendy cop drama ""Miami Vice"" (NBC, 1984-89). More than just a hit show, ""Miami Vice"" was a cultural watermark that set the trend for pastel Armani suits, three-day beards, and sockless feet stuffed into loafers - all set to a rock-n-roll beat. Johnson also starred in such movies as ""Sweet Hearts Dance"" (1988), ""Dead Bang"" (1989) and ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man"" (1991).

Born in Lexington, Kentucky, Shannon's parents divorced when he was a young boy, so he spent time living in both Lexington and Chicago (his father was a professor at Chicago's DePaul University). Shannon eventually stayed in Chicago and became drawn to the Windy City's thriving theater scene. He started acting in his late teens, and at 19 helped co-found A Red Orchid Theatre in Chicago. Although theater acting was Shannon's first love (he also performed regularly at Chicago's iconic Steppenwolf Theatre), by the mid-90s he began gravitating towards film and acting work. Shannon made a cameo as a groomsman in the 1993 Bill Murray comedy ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), and appeared in two films in 1997: ""The Ride"" and ""Chicago Cab."" By the 2000s Shannon's acting career really began to pick up steam. In addition to appearing in Michael Bay's blockbuster action film ""Pearl Harbor"" in 2001, Shannon would go on to earn praise for his performances in ""8 Mile"" (2002), ""Bug"" (2006), and ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" (2007). In 2008 Shannon played a highly intelligent academic, who's also clinically insane, in the period drama ""Revolutionary Road."" The film, which also starred Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, earned Shannon his first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. In the years that followed his role in ""Revolutionary Road,"" Shannon continued earning raves for his performances in films like ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans"" (2009), ""Take Shelter,"" ""Mud"" (2012), and ""99 Homes."" In 2010 he also began earning raves for playing a prohibition-era government agent on HBO's gangster series ""Boardwalk Empire"" (HBO, 2010-14). With his acting career on the rise, Shannon earned his second Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor in 2017 for his role in director Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"" (2016). 2017 was also the year Shannon co-starred in Guillermo del Toro's fantasy drama ""The Shape of Water,"" which would go on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. The following year, in 2018, Shannon starred in two TV mini-series: ""Waco"" (Paramount Network, 2018) and ""The Little Drummer Girl"" (AMC, 2018). By 2019 Shannon had already amassed an impressive body of film and television acting work, but showed no signs of slowing down. That same year he appeared in director Rian Johnson's crime comedy ""Knives Out"" (2019). That film, which centers on an investigation into the death of a family patriarch, was released in late 2019."

He soon began trolling for auditions in the Mojave area, but turned up few options, so he eventually enrolled at Los Angeles' John Casablancas Modeling and Career Center. This soon led to him auditioning for commercials, but those opportunities gave him little inspiration. His big break came when he was cast as Mark in the short film ""Short Term 12"" (2008). He would reprise the role for the feature length adaptation in 2013, performing a rap that he composed himself for the film. Still more prominent roles would follow, such as Jimmie Lee Jackson in the acclaimed civil rights movie ""Selma"" (2014) and a co-starring role in the indie hit ""Dope"" (2015). He would also appear in Don Cheadle's biopic of legendary trumpeter Miles Davis, ""Miles Ahead"" (2016).

In a remarkably short period of time, the boy began to land starring roles in numerous television commercials, then broke into movies by portraying a young Chris Evans in the romantic comedy ""Playing it Cool"" (2014). Jaeden next signed for an even more prominent part, with third billing opposite Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy in the Weinstein Company comedy ""St. Vincent"" (2014), directed by Ted Melfi. In that picture, Lieberher played the son of divorced parents, who ends up falling into the care of a curmudgeonly, middle aged drinker and gambler played by Murray.

After the run of the series, Segan began making his mark on the movies world. He formed a relationship with director Rian Johnson while starring as a key character in the neo-noir mystery film ""Brick"" (2005). Following this turn, Segan explored a variety of genres, taking roles in comedies like ""Adam & Steve"" (2005) and dramas like ""Self Medicated"" (2005). Beginning with ""The Visitation"" (2006), Segan seemed to home in on the horror banner, under which he'd earn especial esteem for his villainous performance in ""Deadgirl"" (2008). After reteaming with director Johnson for ""The Brothers Bloom"" (2008), Segan continued to feed his appetite for horror with ""Someone's Knocking at the Door"" (2009), ""Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever"" (2009), and ""All About Evil"" (2010).

After headlining for three of the world's most noted theater companies, Plummer starred in a host of movies; most memorably playing Baron Georg Von Trapp in the smash hit musical ""The Sound of Music"" (1965). Though he remained prolific both on stage and onscreen, earning awards in several mediums, Plummer languished for the next few decades in mostly mediocre projects that were beneath his skill set. But in 1997, he delivered a Tony Award-winning performance as the besotted actor John Barrymore in ""Barrymore"" that earned him the considerable attention that had previously eluded him. From that point on, he became a much in-demand character actor, playing ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Mike Wallace in ""The Insider"" (1999), Captain Christopher Newport in ""The New World"" (2005), and a managing partner of a power law firm in the excellent political thriller, ""Syriana"" (2005).

They moved from England to Belgium, then Montana, before settling in Oakland, California. Oz began puppeteering at age 12. When he was 17 he met Jim Henson at a Puppeteers of America festival, and went to join him in New York the next year, after graduating from high school. His first on screen puppeteering came in 1963, when he was the right hand of Henson's Rowlf the Dog on ""The Jimmy Dean Show"" (ABC, 1963-1966). When ""Sesame Street"" (NET, 1969; PBS, 1970- ; HBO, 2016-) premiered, Oz became part of the fabric of children's lives around the country. He created and performed some of the best-loved characters on the show, including Bert, Grover, and Cookie Monster. The trend continued with ""The Muppet Show"" (ITV/ABC, 1976-1981), with Oz performing Miss Piggie, Fozzy Bear, Animal, and more. The shows was nominated for Emmys for Outstanding Comedy-Variety and/or Music Series three times and won the award in 1978. Oz created and performed the role of Yoda in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), his first major success without Henson. His first directing credit came when he paired with Henson to direct the fantasy ""The Dark Crystal"" (1982). Oz managed to completely escape Henson's muppet empire when he directed ""Little Shop of Horrors"" (1986). The success of that film helped propel a directing career that included ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" (1988), ""Bowfinger"" (1999), and ""The Stepford Wives"" (2004) among others.

These included her notable 1977 appearance on the ""All in the Family"" (CBS 1971-79) episode ""Cousin Liz,"" in which Edith Bunker (Jean Stapleton) learned about the relationship between Callan's lesbian character Veronica and Edith Bunker's now-deceased Cousin Liz. Following work in notable films such as the police drama ""The Onion Field"" (1979) and the controversial ""American Gigolo"" (1980), Callan became one of the most in-demand guest character actresses on TV in the 1980s and '90s. All preceded the role for which she is most likely known, that of Superman's adoptive mom Martha Kent on ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" (ABC 1993-97). Following that show's conclusion, she went on to brief feature roles in the atmospheric ""CarnivÃ le"" (HBO 2003-2005), Tyler Perry's ""Meet the Browns"" (TBS 2009-2012) and as Lily's (Alyson Hannigan) grandmother Lois on ""How I Met Your Mother"" (CBS 2005-2014). Her next recurring role came on the dark hospital comedy-drama ""Getting On"" (HBO 2013-15)."

Hardboiled by way of Dashiell Hammett, ""Brick"" was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival and announced Johnson as a fresh new voice in independent film. From there, he diversified his talents, directing music videos for bands like The Mountain Goats, and helming episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" (A&E, 2008-2013) and ""Terriers"" (FX, 2010). He went on to direct his second feature, ""The Brothers Bloom"" (2009), which failed to live up to the precedent he set with his breakthrough film. But he did earn considerable acclaim for his third film, ""Looper"" (2012), a dark and gritty sci-fi thriller that proved Johnson was a significant filmmaker with a bright future. That promise was fulfilled when Johnson was announced as the writer and director of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017)."

Starting as a child actor, Moss graduated high school two years early. As a result of her unusually mature work ethic, Moss was rarely without a job. After working steadily in film and television for years, Moss landed her big break in 1999 when she was cast as Martin Sheen's daughter on ""The West Wing"" (NBC, 1999-2006). Moving from her supporting berth at the White House, Moss took on an even more high-profile role as 1960s-era secretary-turned-copywriter Peggy Olson on ""Mad Men"" (AMC, 2007-15), the critically acclaimed drama from ""The Sopranos"" (HBO, 1999-2007) writer-producer, Matthew Weiner. As that series continued, Peggy became one of its most important characters as a foil to and protÃ©gÃ© of conflicted adman Don Draper (Jon Hamm), Even before ""Mad Men"" ended in 2015, Moss went on to strong work as the lead of Jane Campion's murder mystery ""Top of the Lake"" (Sundance 2013) and its sequel ""Top of the Lake: China Girl"" (Sundance 2017) before starring as Offred in the Emmy Award-winning drama ""The Handmaid's Tale"" (Hulu 2017- ).

(Adult Swim, 2007-2010) and ""Tim & Eric's Bedtime Stories"" (Adult Swim, 2014- ). The Pennsylvania natives teamed in 1994 while students at Temple University, and quickly established themselves in alternative comedy circles with their unique perspective on entertainment and popular culture. As the main writers, directors and stars in their series, Heidecker and Wareheim celebrated the most uncomfortable and occasionally unpleasant elements of amateur productions, public access television, late-night commercials and vanity projects; their comedy style hewed somewhere between the free-form absurdity of ""Mr. Show""  (HBO, 1995-98) and the disquieting awkwardness of confrontational surrealists like David Lynch or Werner Herzog. The duo's cutting edge comedy attracted numerous big name guest stars like Will Ferrell and Ben Stiller, and led to guest appearances for Heidecker in Hollywood projects like ""Bridesmaids"" (2011). And if mainstream audiences didn't wholly embrace his own efforts with Wareheim, the best of their work remained some of the most adventurous, cutting-edge comedy programming on television."

Born July 15, 1987 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Abdul-Mateen was raised in the city's Magnolia Projects before relocating with his family to Oakland, California. There, he harbored a desire to become an actor, but pursued a career in architecture, earning a degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and working for a period of time as a city planner in San Francisco. But upon being laid off, Abdul-Mateen took a risk and focused his energy on becoming an actor; he was soon cast in a local stage production, which prompted him to apply to the Yale Drama School, where he earned a master's degree in fine arts. More stage work followed, including roles with the Williamstown Festival in Massachusetts and New York's Shakespeare in the Park, before Abdul-Mateen made his television debut as Cadillac, a vain, disco-dancing club owner in the Baz Luhrmann-produced ""The Get Down."" The praise afforded to him by his performance led to steady and diverse work in features and on television; in the former capacity, he moved deftly from broad comedies like ""Baywatch"" (2017) to musicals like ""The Greatest Showman,"" which cast him as acrobat W.D. Wheeler, and indie efforts like ""First Match"" (2018), for which he played the estranged father of a teenaged girl and aspiring wrestler. On the small screen, Abdul-Mateen appeared on ""The Handmaid's Tale"" (Hulu, 2017- ) and was cast in HBO's ""Watchmen"" series, but his breakout role came in theaters when he was tapped to play the undersea bounty hunter Black Manta, longtime nemesis to ""Aquaman"" in James Wan's feature adaptation of the venerable DC Comics fantasy title."

There, she met a talent agent who encouraged her to go to Los Angeles. Diop made her television debut in 2006 with a recurring role on the sitcom ""Everybody Hates Chris"" (UPN/The CW, 2005-09). She worked steadily in guest appearances on series like ""Whitney"" (NBC, 2011-13) and ""Southland"" (NBC/TNT, 2009-2013) before making her feature film debut in the independent thriller ""The Moment"" (2013) opposite Jennifer Jason Leigh. Diop moved up to series regular with the ambitious fantasy-thriller series ""The Messengers"" (The CW, 2014-15), playing a murderous nurse who returned from a coma to assume the role of Death in the Four Horsemen. The series lasted a single season, and Diop moved on to a recurring role on the Oprah Winfrey-produced ""Greenleaf"" before joining the cast of the highly anticipated ""24: Legacy,"" a spin-off of the Kiefer Sutherland series, with Corey Hawkins as a former Army Ranger targeted by terrorists.

A veteran of the Second City improvisational group, Peele broke into television with ""MADtv,"" which earned him widespread praise for celebrity impersonations and unhinged recurring characters. After netting a 2008 Emmy nomination for writing the comic music video ""Sad Fitty Cent,"" Peele left ""MAD"" to work on other series before reteaming with Key for their own show. ""Key & Peele"" was both a critical and audience favorite thanks to the stars' take on racially tinged subjects, including a supremely formal President Barack Obama (played by Peele). The popularity of the series led to additional high-profile opportunities for the stars and underscored both Key and Peele's ascent to the higher echelons of the comedy business. That success led to the duo's first big-screen effort, the action comedy ""Keanu"" (2016), in which the pair took on a violent street gang over a stolen kitten. In a somewhat unexpected shift of direction, Peele's first high-profile solo gig was the horror film ""Get Out"" (2017), which he wrote and directed; a racially-charged satirical film in the tradition of ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968) and ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975), ""Get Out"" was a major critical and commercial success that poised Peele for a career apart from his longtime friend and partner."

Born in Los Angeles, CA in 1969 to artistic parents, Blum graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Economics and Film before landing senior roles at Ethan Hawke's Malaparte Theater Company and Miramax Films' Acquisitions department. Blum managed to source the funding for his first production, Noah Baumbach's directorial debut ""Kicking and Screaming"" (1995), thanks to an endorsement letter from family friend Steve Martin, and went onto add Shakespeare adaptation ""Hamlet"" (2000), TV movie ""Hysterical Blindness"" (HBO, 2002) and summer camp documentary ""Stagedoor"" (2006) to his credits before hitting it big with ""Paranormal Activity"" (2007), a found-footage horror which cost just $15000 to make but made an astonishing $200 million at the box office. The film was also the first to be released by Blumhouse Productions, the company Blum had founded in 2000, spawned numerous hit sequels and provided the model for several other hit franchises including ""Insidious"" (2010), ""Sinister"" (2012) and ""The Purge"" (2013). Blum then moved into television with the likes of supernatural action adventure ""The River"" (ABC, 2012), paranormal reality series ""Stranded"" (Syfy, 2013) and sci-fi miniseries ""Ascension"" (Syfy, 2014), later winning Emmys for his production work on AIDS crisis drama ""The Normal Heart"" (HBO, 2014) and compelling crime documentary ""The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst"" (HBO, 2015). Blum also continued to diversify in his big-screen work, picking up an Oscar nomination for ""Whiplash"" (2014), and adding comedy ""Stretch"" (2014), thriller ""The Gift"" (2015) and musical fantasy ""Jem and the Holograms"" (2015) to his filmography, while still shaping the world of horror with hits such as ""Ouija"" (2015), ""Unfriended"" (2015) and ""The Visit"" (2015)."

Born in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks participated in school plays, discovering that acting was a good outlet for his energy and wit. He went on to study theater at California State University, Sacramento and as a three-year intern at Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio. He finally moved to New York in 1979 and made his film debut in the low budget horror movie ""He Knows You're Alone"" (1979). The following year, Hanks landed his first big break, co-starring in the sitcom ""Bosom Buddies"" (ABC, 1980-82) with Peter Scolari. He starred in the hit fantasy-comedy ""Splash"" (1984) with Daryl Hannah two years later, which he quickly followed with the zany comedy ""Bachelor Party"" (1984). Hanks' feature film career was off and running, and he continued his hot streak with the comedies ""The Man with One Red Shoe"" (1985) and ""The Money Pit"" (1985). Though he experienced some turbulence in his personal life when he and wife Samantha Lewes were divorced in 1987, his next professional triumph remained just around the corner, as he was soon starring as a 13 year old boy trapped in a 32 year old man's body in Penny Marshall's smash hit ""Big"" (1988). Hanks remarried actor Rita Wilson that same year, and embarked on a string of cult hits like ""The 'Burbs'"" (1989) and ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" (1990). By 1992, he was well established as star and ready for the next phase in his career, and he impressed both audiences and critics with an unexpected performance as a washed up baseball player turned coach in the acclaimed World War II era sports film ""A League of Their Own"" (1992). Hanks quickly followed this with a turn as a widowed father looking for love opposite Meg Ryan in the massively popular ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (1993). He followed this with two back-to-back award-winning performances, one as a gay man suffering from both AIDS and discrimination in ""Philadelphia"" (1993), and another as an intellectually limited man who plays a pivotal role in history in Ron Howard's ""Forrest Gump"" (1994). Hanks would reteam with Howard the following year to portray astronaut Jim Lovell in ""Apollo 13"" (1995), the same year he began voice acting the role of cowboy doll Woody in the cutting-edge CG family film ""Toy Story"" (1995). Ready to expand his horizons further, Hanks next opted to direct his first feature, the period movie ""That Thing You Do!"" (1996), in which he also played a supporting role. Hanks rounded out the '90s with a turn in the acclaimed war film ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) before reteaming with Meg Ryan for another romance, ""You've Got Mail"" (1998). Hanks reprised the role of Woody for ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) before wowing audiences with his performance as a man battling for survival against both loneliness and the elements in ""Cast Away"" (2000). The 2000s would bring still more nuanced and relatable roles for Hanks in films like ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) and ""The Terminal"" (2004). He took on the lead role of Robert Langdon in the hotly anticipated film adaptation of the bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" (2006) as well as the sequel ""Angels & Demons"" (2009), and was greeted with as much affection as ever with his third performance as Woody in ""Toy Story 3"" (2010). Hanks directed and starred in his second feature, ""Larry Crowne"" (2011) in 2011. As a whole, the 2010s would find Hanks utilizing the gravity and trust that came with his own screen persona, playing famous figures like Walt Disney in ""Saving Mr Banks"" (2013), pirate survivor Captain Richard Phillips in ""Captain Phillips"" (2013), and pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger in ""Sully"" (2016). After reprising Robert Langdon for ""Inferno"" (2016) and Woody for ""Toy Story 4"" (2019), Hanks took on the role of children's television pioneer Fred Rogers in ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" (2019)."

Early setbacks like the death of his father and a stint in prison gave Allen the drive to pursue comedy, and his affectionate dissection of the differences between the genders -- focusing especially on the confusions of modern masculinity -- spring-boarded him to stand-up stardom, leading to the massive hit sitcom, ""Home Improvement"" (ABC, 1991-99). The show won him buckets of awards and fans around the world for his portrayal of lovable lunkhead Tim ""The Tool Man"" Taylor. Notching a No. 1 book Don't Stand Too Close to a Naked Man, a TV show and a hit movie at the same time in a rare entertainment trifecta, and Allen went on to rule the box office with two trilogies: ""The Santa Clause"" (1994, 2002, 2006) and ""Toy Story"" (1995, 1999, 2010). Fans followed him to other projects, too; Allen toplined moneymakers like ""Galaxy Quest"" (1999), ""Christmas with the Kranks"" (2004) and ""Wild Hogs"" (2007), and returned to television with a second hit show, ""Last Man Standing"" (ABC 2011-17). Even as his star momentum slowed, the goodwill Allen built up with his early, supernova-level success seemed to assure the comedian as long a career as he chose."

Born in Nashville and raised in Kentucky, Potts always dreamt of becoming an actress. She attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri where she first began taking drama courses. After graduating, Potts continued her acting studies with post-graduate work in California. However, Potts's burgeoning acting career was nearly derailed in her early 20s when she and her then husband were involved in a major car accident in New Mexico. Potts survived, thankfully, but broke several bones as a result from the wreck and was laid up for weeks in the hospital. After recovering from the accident, Potts pushed forward with her fledgling acting career. She made her feature film debut in 1978's ""Corvette Summer"" which also starred Mark Hamill, who was fresh off his starring role in the blockbuster ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977). Potts continued nabbing roles throughout the early 1980s but it was her supporting role as a wise-cracking secretary in 1984's ""Ghostbusters"" that really put her on the map. The huge success of ""Ghostbusters"" put Potts into the purview of casting agents seemingly overnight and before long she was appearing in popular 80s films like ""Crimes of Passion"" (1984), ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986), and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1986). Then in 1986 Potts joined the cast of the CBS sitcom ""Designing Women."" She played the role of Mary Jo Shively on the series, which also starred Delta Burke and Dixie Carter. Potts appeared in all 163 episodes of the series, which ended its 7 season run in 1993. Potts' next big role came in 1995 when she was cast as the voice of Bo Peep in the Pixar animated film ""Toy Story"" (1995). Potts reprised her role as Bo Peep in two subsequent ""Toy Story"" sequels, including 2019's ""Toy Story 4."" Potts continued acting regularly in both films and on TV shows well into the 2010s. In 2013 she landed a recurring role on ""The Fosters"" (Freeform, 2013-18). In 2017 she joined the cast of the highly anticipated spin-off series ""Young Sheldon."" The sitcom, which was told from the point-of-view of Sheldon Cooper from ""The Big Bang Theory"" (CBS, 2007-2019) at 9-years-old, was an immediate success, and premiered its third season in the fall of 2019."

As the Oedipal Byron ""Buster"" Bluth, Hale generated big laughs with his portrayal of the immature, almost child-like member of the highly dysfunctional Bluth family. Prior to ""Arrested Development,"" he was featured in a nationally televised VW commercial, where he sat in the driver's seat singing the words to Styx's ""Mr. Roboto,"" which he later parodied on the show. But despite the critical success of ""Arrested Development,"" the show was canceled after three seasons due to low ratings, though six years later Netflix commissioned the production of another 10 episodes. Meanwhile, Hale was a guest star on a variety of dramas and comedies like ""Community"" (NBC/Yahoo, 2009-2015) and ""Justified"" (FX, 2010-15), and even broke into features with supporting roles in ""Stranger than Fiction"" (2006), ""RV"" (2006) and ""The Tale of Despereaux"" (2008). He returned to the small screen with a number of guest and recurring roles until becoming a series regular on the satirical comedy ""Veep"" (HBO, 2012- ), where his hailed performance as a sycophantic vice presidential aide put on display his preternatural gift for comedy."

Born in Southfield, Michigan in 1971 to an African American father and white mother, Key was adopted by parents who, by chance, reflected the same racial makeup. Key would later cite the regular ""code switching"" he engaged in between the two cultures within his family as contributing to his interest in playing different characters. Key eventually earned a bachelor's degree in theater from the University of Detroit Mercy as well as a master's from Pennsylvania State University. He was a mainstage cast member at Detroit's Second City improv theater before relocating to Chicago to join that city's even more prestigious Second City location. After a few years, he made the move to Los Angeles to pursue a career on screen, where he slowly began to accrue credits with appearances on ""ER"" (NBC, 1994-2009) and in the film ""Uncle Nino"" (2002). In 2004, Key was cast on the sketch comedy series ""MADtv"" along with another up-and-coming comedy performer named Jordan Peele. Key played a number of beloved recurring characters on the show such as Eugene Struthers and Coach Hines, and when he left the show in 2009, he and castmate Peele opted to pitch their own series to Comedy Central. ""Key and Peele"" proved both a critical and commercial hit, with Key's regular characters like Luther the Anger Translator becoming pop culture sensations. Key also appeared in recurring roles on ""Fargo"" (FX, 2014-) and ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-2015) at this time, in addition to co-starring with Lennon Parham and Jessica St. Clair on the largely improvised series ""Playing House"" (USA, 2014-17) and making a small but hilariously memorable appearance in the comedy ""Let's Be Cops"" (2014). When ""Key and Peele"" wrapped in 2015, he appeared in the feature film ""Tomorrowland"" (2015) and began providing the voice of American Ranger on the animated series ""SuperMansion"" (Crackle, 2015- ). The next year, Key re-teamed with Peele for the absurdist comedy film ""Keanu"" (2016) and honored his roots as an improvisor with the sleeper hit ""Don't Think Twice"" (2016). Then in 2017, Key began starring on the comedy-drama series ""Friends from College"" (Netflix, 2017-19). Though the show lasted only two seasons, it was a major critical hit, increasing Key's reputation as not just a gifted comedian but a talented actor. He quickly moved forward, co-starring with Eddie Murphy in ""Dolemite is My Name"" (2019) as well as with John Cena in the family comedy ""Playing with Fire"" (2019), as well as reteaming with Peele as a double act in ""Toy Story 4."""

Channeling screen sirens from the 1950s, Hendricks earned praise for her performance while becoming a role model for full-figured women, thanks to her oft-discussed hourglass figure that harkened back to the days of Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner. Prior to her breakthrough on ""Mad Men,"" she cut her teeth in episodes of ""Undressed"" (MTV, 1999-2002) and ""Angel"" (The WB, 1999-2004), before landing her first significant part as a career-climbing intern on the showbiz satire ""Beggars and Choosers"" (Showtime, 1999-2001). From there, Hendricks appeared on Joss Whedon's short-lived cult hit ""Firefly"" (Fox, 2002-03) and the equally brief drama ""Kevin Hill"" (UPN, 2004-05), while guest starring on more stable shows like ""Without a Trace"" (CBS, 2002-09) and ""Cold Case"" (CBS, 2003-2010). But everything turned on a dime after Hendricks was cast on ""Mad Men,"" leading to widespread acclaim and awards nominations, as well as career-expanding feature roles in ""Drive"" (2011) and ""Ginger and Rosa"" (2012). Following the end of ""Mad Men"" in 2015, Hendricks moved on quickly, co-starring in the quirky comedy ""Another Period"" (Comedy Central 2015- ) and the crime drama ""Hap and Leonard"" (Sundance 2016- ). Whether playing a demure waif or a smoldering vixen, the always striking Hendricks defined a new style of old-school glamour while bringing her finely honed skills to every role."
258,Keanu Reeves,9/2/1964,"Beirut, Lebanon",https://resizing.flixster.com/C0pQsHJAbmGNexFy6x0_PBYgYAw=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1443_v9_bc.jpg,"Canadian actor Keanu Reeves enjoyed a protean film career that encompassed broad comedies like ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" (1988), action blockbusters like ""Speed"" (1994), ""The Matrix"" (1999) and ""John Wick"" (2015) and arthouse projects like ""My Own Private Idaho"" (1990) over the course of several decades.  Born Keanu Charles Reeves on September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon, he was the son of Samuel Nowlin Reeves, Jr., an American of Chinese-Hawaiian, English, Irish and Portuguese descent, and Patricia Taylor, who hailed from England. His parents separated when Reeves was three years of age, and Taylor, who worked as a costume designer, took their son with her on various assignments in Sydney, Australia and New York City before settling in Toronto, Ontario. There, Reeves' mother would marry and divorce three more husbands, while her son, raised primarily by grandparents and nannies, cycled through several Toronto high schools while nurturing an interest in hockey. But roles in theater productions convinced him to pursue a career as an actor, and he soon logged appearances in local television commercials and episodic series. After making his feature film debut as a Quebecois goalie in the Rob Lowe hockey drama, ""Youngblood"" (1986), Reeves headed south to Los Angeles, where he found steady work in various American TV-movies and episodic programs. But after earning solid notices for a dramatic turn as a thoughtful teenager caught up in a murder in Tim Hunter's ""The River's Edge"" (1986), Reeves graduated to features, where his quiet intensity and exotic good looks initially minted him as a romantic juvenile lead or bruised antihero in films like ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1988) and ""Permanent Record"" (1988). But he showed an unexpected knack for comedy with his turn as a good-natured, if slow-witted teen traveling through time in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" (1989), which led to a slew of roles as goofy but earnest young men in Ron Howard's ""Parenthood"" (1989) and the Lawrence Kasden-penned ""I Love You To Death"" (1990). Reeves proved to be almost too adept at these roles, which undermined efforts to play more serious roles, like his surfing FBI agent in Kathryn Bigelow's ""Point Break"" (1991), Englishman Jonathan Harker in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) for Francis Ford Coppola, and a Shakespearean villain in Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (1993), for which he was the subject of much critical scorn. But a turn as a gay hustler in Gus Van Sant's ""My Own Private Idaho"" (1992) silenced a few critics, as did the box office success of ""Speed"" (1994), with Reeves as a stalwart police officer helping Sandra Bullock pilot a runaway bus. To the surprise of many industry observers, Reeves turned down the inevitable sequel to ""Speed"" in favor of touring with his band, Dogstar, and appearing in a 1995 production of ""Hamlet"" in Winnipeg. When he returned to Hollywood, Reeves continued to keep his distance from traditional studio fare, preferring instead to devote his energies to arthouse efforts like ""A Walk in the Clouds"" (1995) for Alfonso Arau and Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Little Buddha"" (1995), which cast him as the adult Buddha. Neither of these efforts, or subsequent projects like ""Feeling Minnesota"" (1996), found much support at the box office, and he was a supporting player in two of his most successful projects of this period - ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997), with Al Pacino, and ""The Replacements"" (2000), with Gene Hackman. A personal tragedy in the loss of a child with longtime significant other Jennifer Syme, who would herself pass away two years later, added a layer of emotional loss to his downward spiraling fortunes, but in 1999, he rebounded as Neo, a hacker who discovers a secret world within computer technology in ""The Matrix."" An unqualified hit for its remarkable special effects and imaginative scripting, it was followed by two blockbuster sequels (""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" both 2003), and with the success of Nancy Meyers' comedy ""Something's Gotta Give"" (2003), with Reeves as Jack Nicholson's romantic rival for Diane Keaton, and ""Constantine"" (2005), with Reeves as DC Comics' demon hunter, he had returned as a bankable box office star. Reeves soon settled into a breathless schedule of studio and independent efforts, ranging from a remake of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (2008) and ""The Lake House"" (2008), which reunited him with ""Speed"" star Sandra Bullock, to Richard Linklater's animated adaptation of Philip K. Dick's ""A Scanner Darkly"" (2006) and the martial arts actioner ""The 47 Ronin"" (2013). He also branched out to embrace a variety of projects, from a picture book for grown-ups to producing the digital filmmaking documentary ""Side by Side"" (2011) and making his directorial debut with ""Man of Tai Chi"" (2013). The U.S.-Chinese co-production, inspired in part by the life of Reeves' friend, stuntman Tiger Chen, took five years to complete, which Reeves funded through steady work in dozens of features. The most unexpectedly successful of these was ""John Wick"" (2015), directed by stunt man Chad Stahelski, who was also Reeves' stunt double. The film, an ultra-violent tribute to noir and martial arts films, starred Reeves as a former hitman who waged war on the Russian gangster that stole his car and killed his dog. Its stylistic excesses drew positive reviews and $88 million at the box office, and was followed by two more hit sequels, ""John Wick: Chapter 2"" (2017) and ""John Wick: Chapter 3-Parabellum"" (2019). Between these efforts, Reeves collaborated with director Nicholas Winding Refn on his surreal ""Neon Demon"" (2016), gave an amusing cameo as an exaggerated version of himself in the Netflix feature ""Always Be My Maybe"" (2019) and lent his voice to a Canadian stunt rider toy in ""Toy Story 4"" (2019)."

While riding an elevator in a high rise in his native Los Angeles, the young man was approached by talent manager Howard Tyner who suggested Hernandez had what it took to have a successful career in Hollywood. In 1998, he made his TV series debut as Antonio Lopez, a high school basketball player, in the Saturday morning teen sitcom ""Hang Time"" (NBC 1998-2000) and stayed with the show for two seasons. Hernandez moved to MTV with the short-term role of pizza delivery guy Eddie on the popular late-night serial ""Undressed"" (MTV 1999-2002) before segueing to the big screen. Although he shot roles in two movies (""Living the Life"" and ""Joy Ride"") in 2000, neither had been released before his first lead role hit the multiplexes. In 2001, Hernandez co-starred with Kirsten Dunst in the teen romance ""crazy/beautiful,"" portraying stalwart, straight-A high school student Carlos Nunez, whose plans to attend the US Naval Academy are threatened by his growing attraction to a self-destructive rich girl. He next appeared in Disney's surprise hit film of 2002, ""The Rookie,"" as high school baseball team captain ""Wack"" Campos, and had a supporting role in the videogame-ish actioner ""Torque"" (2004). He next appeared in the melodramatic ""Ladder 49"" (2004), playing a firefighter who, along with other members of his crew, struggles to rescue a seasoned veteran (Joaquin Phoenix) trapped inside a burning building. Hernandez moved on to Peter Berg's acclaimed sports drama, ""Friday Night Lights"" (2004), a true-life story about the Permian High School Panthers' quest for a fifth-straight championship. Hernandez played a level-headed tight end with a one-way ticket to Harvard. He next starred in Eli Roth's ""Hostel"" (2005), a brutal horror flick about two American college buddies (Hernandez and Derek Richardson) lured to an out-of-the-way Slovakian hostel. Hernandez starred in ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power"" (2006), a prequel to the 1993 film starring Al Pacino, depicting merciless kingpin Carlito Brigante's rise to power after being lured into a deadly circle of greed and retribution. Hernandez next appeared in ""World Trade Center"" (2006), Oliver Stone's sober and heart-wrenching look at the September 11th terrorist attacks. Hernandez returned to regular television series work with ""Six Degrees"" (ABC 2006-07), a one-hour drama about the intertwining lives of six New Yorkers who are all strangers to one another. Back in the feature world, Hernandez signed on for a small role in ""Stop-Loss"" (2006), a war drama about a soldier returning home to Texas from Iraq who is recalled, but refuses to return to battle. Meanwhile, Hernandez returned for the sequel ""Hostel: Part II"" (2007) and took on supporting roles in the dramas ""American Son"" (2008) and ""Lakeview Terrace"" (2008). A co-starring role in found-footage thriller ""Quarantine"" (2008) was followed by steady supporting work in films ranging from Miley Cyrus-starring teen drama ""LOL"" (2012) to family-friendly animal drama ""Max"" (2015). Hernandez raised his profile significantly with key roles in raunchy comedy ""Bad Moms"" (2016) and DC Comics supervillain-ensemble blockbuster ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), in which he costarred as El Diablo."

While working on the coolly absurd animated series ""Johnny Bravo"" for the Cartoon Network (which would later become home to such other Alan-starring projects as ""The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy""), the actress met writer Seth MacFarlane. Their partnership landed Alan on McFarlane's smash animated sitcom ""Family Guy,"" wherein she is recurrently heard as the snippy and undercutting anchorwoman Diane Simmons. With a natural ability to appeal to both children and adults, Alan went on to provide vocal effects for such crowd-pleasing Pixar films as ""WALL-E"" and ""Toy Story 3."" She also voices the teenage sperm whale Pearl Krabs on Nickelodeon's winningly loony ""SpongeBob SquarePants.""

But unlike her better known sibling, she earned an Academy Award nomination for her performance in ""Working Girl"" (1988), which came hot on the heels of her breakout role in ""Broadcast News"" (1987). From there, she accumulated a long list of credits where she played the best friend, sidekick or scourge, most notably in ""Say Anything"" (1989), ""My Blue Heaven"" (1990) and ""Addams Family Values"" (1993).  While she did land the occasional dramatic role, as happened with ""Arlington Road"" (1999) and ""The Cradle Will Rock"" (1999), Cusack seemed content with her position as a character actress. Though her career was not without its setbacks - a failed sitcom run in early 2001 paid testament to that - Cusack nonetheless remained secure in herself and career, becoming by the late 1990s and early 2000s, one of the most dependable supporting players working in Hollywood."

The irreverent, chatty, daytime outlet proved a good fit for the comedienne whose accessible Midwestern persona and warmth had won over middle American audiences in sitcoms and supporting film roles in wholesome family comedies. Behind the scenes, however, she was a serious and accomplished Hollywood producer, screenwriter, director and the creator of several primetime comedies.

A mainstay of New York's comedy clubs throughout the early 2000s, Schaal made a name for herself as Mel on HBO's surrealist musical comedy, ""Flight of the Conchords"" (HBO, 2007-09), and soon followed that up with appearances on ""Modern Family"" (ABC, 2009- ), ""The Daily Show"" (Comedy Central, 1996- ), as well as a recurring role as Louise Belcher on the animated sitcom, ""Bob's Burgers"" (Fox, 2011- ). Already a rising comedic talent, her unmistakable high-pitched voice work, which has also included characters in ""Toy Story 3"" (2010), ""Despicable Me 2"" (2013) and ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" (2013), has lent further credence to her status as a quirky multi-talented performer. Raised on a cattle farm near Longmont, Colorado, Schaal graduated from Northwestern University, before moving to New York City to pursue a career as a stand-up comic. She started working her way through the New York comedy circuit, and in 2005 made the list of the ""10 Funniest New Yorkers You Never Heard Of"" in New York Magazine. Another career highlight came in 2006 when Schaal was awarded the prestigious ""Best Alternative Comedian"" award at the Aspen Comedy Arts Festival, beating out several dozen of her comedic peers. In 2007 she was exposed to a mainstream audience for the first time after joining the cast of HBO's ""Flight of the Conchords,"" and the following year was hired on as a special correspondent for ""The Daily Show,"" thus becoming even more of a recognizable face on the national stage. When ""Conchords"" ended after two seasons in 2009, Schaal worked harder than ever, nabbing recurring parts on NBC's ""30 Rock"" (2006-2013), ""Gravity Falls"" (Disney Channel, 2012-16) and ""Wilfred"" (2011-14). She also played the awkward triceratops Trixie in ""Toy Story 3"" and lent her voice to the Fox animated series ""Bob's Burgers."" 2013 proved to be a banner year for Schaal-in addition to being featured in two episodes of ""Archer"" (FX, 2009- ), she voiced characters in the blockbuster animated films ""Despicable Me 2"" and ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2."" In 2015, she began starring in a second Sunday night Fox sitcom alongside ""Bob's Burgers."" ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Fox 2015- ), created by and starring Will Forte, co-starred Schaal as quirky, highly-strung Carol Pilbasian, a survivor of a plague that has wiped out the rest of humanity. Between seasons of her two series Schaal co-starred in the Robert Redford film ""A Walk in the Woods"" (2015), Melissa McCarthy's ""The Boss"" (2016), indie comedy ""All Nighter"" (2017) and romantic comedy ""The Wedding Guest"" (2017)."

Shawn announced his arrival with his OBIE-winning play ""Our Late Night"" (1975), which led to a small, but memorable film debut in Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"" (1979). But it was his writing and performance in the art-house hit ""My Dinner with Andre"" (1981) that captured the attention of Hollywood at large. From there he enlivened a number of movies in relatively minor parts before essaying his most remembered character, the maniacal Sicilian Vizzini, in ""The Princess Bride"" (1987).  Shawn segued over to television for recurring roles on ""The Cosby Show"" (NBC, 1984-1992) and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" (syndicated, 1993-99), while carving out yet another career path in animation with the voice role of the insecure Rex in ""Toy Story"" (1995), which he reprised in the 1999 and 2010 sequels. Always capable of elevating even the most mundane of material - as he did with ""My Favorite Martian"" (1999) and ""The Haunted Mansion"" (2003) - Shawn was a favorite among filmmakers and audiences, while continuing to earn considerable acclaim as an award-winning playwright."

She trained at the Cleveland Play House, and later moved to New York City where she joined the Herbert Berghof Studio in Greenwich Village. Squibb landed her first big role as Dulcie in an off-Broadway production of ""The Boyfriend"" in 1958. For most actresses, thirty years spent in Broadway, regional theater, musicals, and cabaret would have been a lifetime's worth of acting.

Except for a recurring role as Pearl in ""The Young and the Restless"" (CBS 1973-), most of her ensuing roles were bit parts in big movies and popular television shows such as ""About Schmidt"" (2002) and ""Two and a Half Men"" (CBS 2003-). However, she surprised everyone in the role of Kate Grant in the 2013 film ""Nebraska."" Director Alexander Payne, whom Squibb worked with previously in ""About Schmidt,"" did not initially think to cast her for the role until she sent her audition tape with her two interpretations of Kate's character, one combative and the other restrained. The former won out as Squibb's Kate became the crass and potty-mouthed wife of the movie's central character, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern). Her performance was critically acclaimed, nominated for numerous film critics awards and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture. In January 2014, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that Squibb was one of the year's Best Supporting Actress nominees."

In the grand tradition of Disney's animation team from the 1930s and such legendary figures as Ray Harryhausen and Don Bluth, Stanton's best films were a near-perfect balance of breathtaking visuals and heart-tugging emotion; the lifelike quality of cowboy toy Woody or the silent, industrious robot WALL-E never overwhelmed their fully rendered hopes and dreams and ambitions. The combination of these elements brought Stanton significant acclaim and considerable awards, but more importantly, it established him as one of the most creative figures in motion pictures - live action and animated - working in 21st century Hollywood."

One of his most famous was ""Short People,"" which became his biggest hit. Though he had his start writing songs and themes for television and film, Newman would not be officially associated with scoring movies until he wrote the music for ""Ragtime"" (1981), which deviated wildly from his sarcastic ditties from a decade prior.

After early work on Irish television and a supporting role opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in the romantic-comedy ""I Could Never Be Your Woman"" (2007), Ronan became one of the most talked about actresses of any age when she appeared in ""Atonement"" (2007). Nominated for dozens of awards for her work alongside Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, she was soon racking up more accolades in such eagerly-awaited projects as ""City of Ember"" (2008), ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009) and ""The Way Back"" (2010). With her astonishing turn as a 16-year-old killing machine in the action-thriller ""Hanna"" (2011), Ronan proved she had both the talent and physical presence to tackle roles beyond the abilities of almost any other actress her age. Competing for parts with the likes of Dakota Fanning and compared to such acting luminaries as Meryl Streep, Ronan looked forward to a career as diverse and rewarding as she chose to make it. She adjusted smoothly to more mature roles with films ranging from Wes Anderson's ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014) to YA dystopia ""The Host"" (2012) before winning two more Oscar nominations with period drama ""Brooklyn"" (2015) and Greta Gerwig's coming of age comedy-drama ""Lady Bird"" (2017) and starring in prestige films such as ""On Chesil Beach"" (2017) and ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2018)."

An early member of Chicago's revered Steppenwolf Theater Company, Metcalf garnered widespread critical acclaim for her performance in the troupe's off-Broadway mounting of ""Balm of Gilead"" in 1984. Four years later, the actress became known to mainstream American audiences as Jackie Harris, the melancholy but well-meaning sister of Roseanne Barr's titular matriarch on the hit sitcom ""Roseanne"" (ABC, 1988-1997; 2018- ). The increased visibility led the accomplished actress to appear in several high-profile feature films of the time, including the crime-thriller ""Internal Affairs"" (1990) and director Oliver Stone's explosive docudrama ""JFK"" (1991). Another memorable role for Metcalf came with the voice of Andy's Mom in the Disney/Pixar animated hit film ""Toy Story"" (1995) and its equally popular sequels. Post-""Roseanne,"" she remained a frequent presence on television with memorable recurring roles on popular series like ""3rd Rock from the Sun"" (NBC, 1996-2001), ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC, 2004-2012) and ""The Big Bang Theory"" (CBS, 2007- ), as well as smaller projects like Louis CK's quirky ""Horace and Pete"" (2016). She also co-starred in the dark sitcom ""Getting On"" (HBO 2013-15) and the family sitcom ""The McCarthys"" (CBS 2014-15), burnishing her leading-lady qualities even though neither series lasted very long. Metcalf capped her late-career renaissance with an Oscar-nominated role as the title character's mother in Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" (2017) and a return to the role that made her famous in a reboot of ""Roseanne"" that was retooled as ""The Conners"" (ABC 2018- ) following Roseanne Barr's firing from the series.

By the time he entered the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts as a teenager, he began taking acting a lot more seriously, and really began to hone in on perfecting his craft. After graduating from LaGuardia High School, Chalamet briefly attended Columbia University in New York, before leaving school to dive head first into a professional film and television acting career in 2008. He initially began appearing in short films like ""Sweet Tooth"" (2008) and ""Clown"" (2008), all while continuing to audition for more meatier film and TV roles. Then in 2012 Chalamet nabbed recurring roles on two major television shows, ""Royal Pains"" (USA Network, 2009-2016) and ""Homeland"" (Showtime, 2011- ), both of which established the still teenage Chalamet as a talented young actor to watch. In 2014 Chalamet nabbed his very first film role in Jason Reitman's comedy-drama ""Men, Women & Children"" (2014). 2014 was also the year he appeared in Christopher Nolan's futuristic space epic ""Interstellar"" (2014). From 2014 onward Chalamet appeared in films only, and through it all established himself as one of the most promising young actors of his generation. His breakout year proved to be 2017 when he appeared in three of the most talked about films of the year: ""Hostiles"" (2017), ""Lady Bird"" and ""Call Me By Your Name."" He earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his role in ""Call Me By Your Name,"" becoming the third youngest actor in history to be nominated for the prestigious award. In 2018 Chalamet appeared in Woody Allen's ""A Rainy Day In New York"" (2018), alongside Elle Fanning. Before the film was released however, Chalamet made headlines for declaring he would donate his entire ""A Rainy Day In New York"" salary to Time's Up, a movement against sexual harassment that was founded in early 2018 by various high-profile Hollywood celebrities in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal of late 2017. In late 2017 Chalamet expressed serious remorse for working with Allen, who for decades had been accused of sexual abuse by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow."

These experiences led to her own behind-the-scenes work with Swanberg, first as co-writer on ""Hannah Takes the Stars"" (2007) and later, as writer-director on ""Nights and Weekends"" (2008), a comedy about a romantically involved couple (Gerwig and Swanberg) who must overcome the challenges of a long-distance relationship. A natural performer with a gift for embodying the anxieties and pleasures inherent in the transition from college age to adulthood, Gerwig was soon courted by mainstream adjacent filmmakers like Noam Baumbach, who cast her as the assistant to an eccentric Hollywood family in ""Greenberg"" (2010), and later became her significant other. Though a box office failure, ""Greenberg"" and her work with the mumblecore scene led to work in Hollywood features: Gerwig was part of a complex love quadrangle with Jesse Eisenberg and Ellen Page in Woody Allen's ""To Rome with Love"" (2012), played Natalie Portman's best friend in Ivan Reitman's ""No Strings Attached"" (2011) and was pursued by boyish millionaire Russell Brand in the remake of ""Arthur"" (2011). But Gerwig also remained connected to her indie roots through performances in Whit Stillman's ""Damsels in Distress"" (2011) and drew critical praise for her turns as young women in various stages of personal collapse and reconstruction in ""Lola Versus"" (2011) and Baumbach's ""Frances Ha"" (2012), which she co-wrote, and which earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. After netting positive reviews for her stage debut in The Village Bike in 2014, Gerwig resumed her busy schedule of roles in independent features, including a turn as a gay woman who engages in a sexual relationship with aging actor Al Pacino in Barry Levinson's ""The Humbling"" (2015), a career woman whose desire to have a baby with a married man leads to complications in Rebecca Miller's ""Maggie's Plan"" (2015), and as the adult version of Heather Matarazzo's hapless Dawn Wiener in Todd Solondz's ""Wiener-Dog"" (2016), a sequel of sorts to his debut, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" (1995). After playing a photographer recovering from cancer in Mike Mills' autobiographical ""20th Century Women"" (2016), Gerwig wrote and directed ""Lady Bird"" (2017), a carefully crafted and painfully honest comedy-drama about an eclectic teenager with artistic ambitions and a challenging home life; the film earned near-universal acclaim, as well as a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, while Gerwig became the fifth woman in motion picture history to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. After voicing a character in Wes Anderson's animated ""Isle of Dogs"" (2018), Gerwig commenced on her next project as writer-director: an adaptation of ""Little Women"" (2019) which reunited her with her ""Lady Bird"" star, Saoirse Ronan. The film opened to universal acclaim on Christmas 2019."

Rudin went on to spend nearly a decade producing steady box office hits for Paramount Pictures, earning as much of a reputation for delivering high quality dramas, comedies and thrillers, as for his notoriously quick temper and revolving door of employees. Shortly after settling into a deal with Disney in 2004, Rudin hit a career high mark when the Coen Brothers' ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007) - which he had produced - and Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will be Blood"" (2007) -which he had executive produced - were both nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture.

Born in Syracuse, New York, he moved around throughout his childhood, including a period in Canada. After graduating from high school in New Jersey, he moved first to New York and then to Los Angeles to pursue acting. He made his film debut in the Brooke Shields vehicle ""Endless Love"" (1981). His next role as an aggressive military cadet opposite Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn in ""Taps"" (1981) caught people's attention. He joined another group of young stars, including Patrick Swayze and Rob Lowe, in Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of the S.E. Hinton novel ""The Outsiders"" (1983). His starring role as schoolboy-turned-pimp Joel in ""Risky Business"" broke him as one of Hollywood's newest celebrities. The long shoot schedule of Ridley Scott's fantasy epic ""Legend"" (1985) briefly took him out of the public eye, but he bounced back with one of the iconic roles of the 1980s. Playing Navy fighter pilot Maverick in Tony Scott's ""Top Gun"" (1986) turned Cruise into a superstar. He began branching into roles with more heft at the same time when he joined Paul Newman for ""The Color of Money"" (1986). He continued in that vein during the next several years, working with high profile directors and co-stars in prestige projects. He partnered with Dustin Hoffman for ""Rain Man"" (1988), Oliver Stone for ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989), and Jack Nicholson for ""A Few Good Men"" (1993), the first two of which were Oscar-winners for Best Picture. The actor picked up his first Academy Award nomination for ""Born on the Fourth of July."" While it didn't garner the same level of critical acclaim, his role as Anne Rice's vampire Lestat opposite a young Brad Pitt in ""Interview with a Vampire"" (1994) became as well-remembered as any of the actor's roles. His 11-year marriage to Nicole Kidman saw the couple partner on three films including Ron Howard's ""Far and Away"" (1992) and Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999). By the '90s, he had his pick of roles and began mixing in big-budget populist fare like ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996), based on the '60s television show of the same name. His role as secret agent Ethan Hunt proved popular enough for a series of sequels that would extend for more than two decades. Cruise also notched a second Oscar nomination for his role as a sports agent gaining a conscious in Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996). He worked with another rising filmmaker when he played motivational speaker Frank Mackey in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" (1999), a role that earned him another Academy Award nomination. After the turn of the century, Cruise bounced between effects-heavy fare like ""Minority Report"" (2002) and ""War of the Worlds"" (2005) to dramas such as ""Lions for Lambs"" (2007) with Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. He also proved himself willing to puncture his own inflated image, with comedic cameos in ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" (2002) and ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), and his musical turn in ""Rock of Ages"" (2012). He similarly adopted a self-effacing posture when fans began noticing that there was a scene of the actor running in nearly all his films. Over the years, he found himself a magnet for the tabloids thanks to his close ties to the Church of Scientology and his celebrity marriages to Kidman and Katie Holmes. Cruise added another action franchise to his resume when he jumped into the role of Lee Child's literary tough guy ""Jack Reacher"" (2012). He would reprise the role in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016). After starring in the big-budget reboot of ""The Mummy"" (2017) and the drama ""American Made"" (2017), he returned to the role that once cemented his superstar status. More than 20 years after the original, Cruise climbed back into the cockpit to revive Maverick for a sequel to his 1986 hit ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2020)."
314,Henry Cavill,5/5/1983,"Jersey, Channel Islands",https://resizing.flixster.com/Y5fkfbrf7479dgUqh3PkwGSVzn0=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/250833_v9_bb.jpg,"British actor Henry Cavill rose to fame in 2013 as the screen incarnation of Superman in ""Man of Steel,"" and reprised the character on several occasions while also providing brawn and gravitas for such hits as ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (2015) and ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018). Born Henry William Dalgliesh Cavill on May 5, 1983 on Jersey, the largest of England's Channel Islands, he began his education at St. Michael's Preparatory School on Jersey before crossing the Channel to attend the Stowe School, a private boarding school near the town of Buckingham, England. He was initially drawn to ancient history, which he hoped to study at university through an armed services scholarship. But a chance encounter with Russell Crowe, who filmed ""Proof of Life"" (2000) at the school, inspired Cavill to turn his interests toward acting, which he pursued through school productions. By chance, a casting director visited Stowe in search of a young actor to play Guy Pearce's son in Kevin Reynolds' version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (2002), and chose Cavill for his looks and relative acting experience. Roles in high-profile British films, including ""I Capture the Castle"" (2003), followed, but within a few years, these had given way to low-budget or largely unseen projects, like Reynolds' ""Tristan and Isolde"" (2006). Cavill had also earned a reputation for missing out on major projects, including two that went to Robert Pattinson - ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005) and ""Twilight"" (2008) - as well as James Bond in ""Casino Royale"" (2006) and ironically, Superman in what would become ""Superman Returns"" (2006). He busied himself instead with supporting turns in Woody Allen's ""Whatever Works"" (2009) and a recurring role as the first Duke of Suffolk on Showtime's historical drama series ""The Tudors"" (BBC Two/CBC Television, 2007-2010). A turn as the mythological hero Theseus in Tarsem Singh's ""Immortals"" (2011) reconfirmed Cavill's knack for physical roles, which in turn put him back in the spotlight for the Superman film franchise. He assumed the cape for Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" (2013) - with his acting inspiration Russell Crowe as Superman's birth father, Jor-El - and reprised the D.C. Comics hero in two more films, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016), with Ben Affleck as the Caped Crusader, and ""Justice League"" (2017), which added Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Between these special effects-fueled epics, Cavill played '60s TV super-spy Napoleon Solo in a big-screen adaptation of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" and played a double-crossing agent opposite Tom Cruise in the blockbuster hit ""Mission Impossible - Fallout."" With an array of hits now under his belt, Cavill divided his time between television, playing a monster hunter in the Netflix fantasy series ""The Witcher"" (2019- ) before moving on to another enduring pop culture figure - Sherlock Holmes - in ""Enola Holmes"" with Millie Bobby Brown of ""Stranger Things"" (Netflix, 2016- ) as the consulting detective's younger and equally talented sister."

Rhames' breakout role as crime kingpin Marsellus Wallace in Quentin Tarantino's unexpected cult hit, ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), brought the actor his first major attention, while independent film fans had a taste of his imposing physicality and brooding air in earlier films, including ""The Saint of Fort Washington"" (1993) and David Mamet's ""Homicide"" (1991).  The actor went on to enjoy a steady screen career and continuous acclaim for his multi-dimensional sidekicks, supporting Tom Cruise in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise (1996, 2000, 2006), and giving strong performances in films like ""Out of Sight"" (1998) and ""Con Air"" (1997), where, among his strengths, was lending a philosophical bent to career criminals and imbuing figures of authority with realistic flaws."

Born Rebecca Louisa Ferguson SundstrÃ¶m on October 19, 1983 in Stockholm, Sweden, she was raised in a bilingual household - her mother was English and her father was Swedish - in the city's Vasastan district. Ferguson began her career in front of cameras in her early teens, first as a model for print publications and later, in television commercials for cosmetics and fashion accessories. After graduating from Adolf Fredrik's Music School in 1999, the 16-year-old Ferguson earned her breakout role as an upper-class teenager on the soap opera ""Nya tider"" (TV, 1999-2006). She left the series after a year and joined the cast of another soap, a Swedish-American series filmed in the United States called ""Ocean Ave.""(TV4, 2002-2003), which received poor reviews; Ferguson then retreated to the coastal town of Simirishamn, where she gave birth to a son with then-boyfriend Ludwig Hallberg in 2007. She remained largely off-screen until 2011, when director Richard Hobert spotted her at the town's market and asked her to appear in his upcoming film, ""A One-Way Trip to Antibes"" (2011). Ferguson was cast as Maria, a duplicitous maid who is blackmailed by elderly widower Sven-Bertil Taube into foiling his children's plan to steal his life savings. She soon returned to steady work on screen, first in Scandinavian features like the drama ""Us"" (2013), and then in English-language projects, beginning in 2013 with ""The White Queen,"" which cast her as commoner turned 15th-century English Queen consort Elizabeth Woodville. Her performance earned a Golden Globe nomination and led to more projects in the UK and United States, though none more high-profile than ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,"" for which she starred as Ilsa Faust, an icy operative connected to a criminal organization. Star Tom Cruise chose Ferguson for the role based on her performance in ""The White Queen,"" and the global success of the film led to starring roles in the spy thriller ""Despite the Falling Snow"" (2016), as Hugh Grant's mistress in the comic biopic ""Florence Foster Jenkins"" (2016), as Justin Theroux's wife and one of several objects of unhealthy fixation by Emily Blunt in ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016), and as a doomed scientist in the 2017 science fiction thriller ""Life"" (2017). Ferguson's run of roles in major features continued unabated in the years that followed: she played singer Jenny Lind in the musical ""The Greatest Showman"" and reprised her turn as Ilsa Faust in ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018), while also lining up prominent roles in ""Men in Black: International,"" ""Doctor Sleep"" (2020) - the sequel to Stephen King's ""The Shining"" - and Denis Villeneuve's epic adaptation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" (2020)."

In 2004's ""Creep,"" he played a monster living in the London Underground. As if that wasn't dark enough, he embodied a real-life monster, Moors murderer Ian Brady, in the BAFTA-winning TV serial ""See No Evil: The Moors Murders,"" and played a violent former football hooligan involved in a campaign of vigilante violence in Nick Love's underground hit ""Outlaw.""

He was raised in an observant Roman Catholic family, and played football at Alfred G. Berner High School in Massapequa before matriculating at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. After three years at college, Baldwin transferred to the Tisch School of the Arts where he eventually became a member of the Actors Studio. Baldwin delayed finishing his degree while he began his acting career, and officially graduated from NYU in 1994, nearly 20 years after he began his college education. In 1986 Baldwin made his Broadway debut in Joe Orton's ""Loot,"" a production that closed after only three months.

Born in Wimbledon, London, Kirby was the daughter of prostate surgeon and university professor Roger Kirby and magazine editor Jane Kirby. By her own account, Kirby had a childhood marked by highs and lows: she was well cared for by her parents, who introduced her to a wide array of film and theater, which eventually spurred her interest in acting. But she also suffered from giardia, an intestinal condition caused by parasites, which required constant and invasive medical attention, and dealt with frequent bullying by other students while attending Lady Eleanor Holles School. Her path to professional acting took a equally challenging route: Kirby was turned down by the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, and took a gap year to travel throughout Africa and Asian before returning to England to enroll at the University of Exeter. She obtained a degree in English and earned an opportunity to study at the London Academy of Musical and Dramatic Arts. But Kirby turned it down to launch her professional career at the Octagon Theatre in 2010; there, she earned rave reviews and the ""Rising Star"" Award from the ""Manchester Evening News."" More critical praised followed her appearances at the Royal National Theatre, as well as her television debut in the '50s-set BBC drama series ""The Hour"" (2011-12). By the following year, Kirby was dividing her time between stage work in the well-received Young Vic production of ""Three Sisters"" (2012), television roles in the BBC's ""Great Expectations"" miniseries (2011) and the Ridley Scott-produced ""Labyrinth"" (Channel 4, 2012) and her first film appearances, beginning in 2012 with the crime drama ""The Rise."" Critical praise for all of these efforts led to roles in major features like Richard Curtis' ""About Time"" (2013) and leads in John Boorman's nostalgic ""Queen & Country"" (2014), as well as award-winning turns in stage productions of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" at the Young Vic in 2014. Despite the exposure, Kirby had yet to receive her breakout screen role; that changed in 2016 when she was cast as Princess Margaret, younger sister to Queen Elizabeth II, on ""The Crown."" Kirby drew stellar reviews for her turn as Margaret, who over the course of the series' first two seasons, emerged from beneath Elizabeth's shadow and from the wreckage of a ruined engagement to find her own way, as well as a bona fide love in photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones (Matthew Goode). For her performance, Kirby netted an Emmy nomination and BAFTA Award, and the expanded exposure led to major roles in Hollywood features, including the arms dealer known as the White Widow on ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" (2018) and ""Hobbs & Shaw"" (2019), a spin-off of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham."

In breaking all the rules for screenwriting - mainly because he was unaware of them - McQuarrie redefined the crime-noir genre and became one of the most sought-after writers in the business. But such blessings came with a price after he was given the chance to direct his first feature, ""The Way of the Gun"" (2000), a graphic thriller that polarized audiences and critics on its way to becoming a box office failure. For the next seven plus years, McQuarrie was trapped in development hell on a number of movies that never made it to production, frustrating him to the point of wanting to quit the business altogether. But Singer managed to pull his old friend back in by directing McQuarrie's spec script for ""Valkyrie"" (2008), a World War II thriller about a Nazi plot to assassinate Hitler. From there, he wrote the scripts for two more critically derided films, ""Killshot"" (2009) and ""The Tourist"" (2010), but managed to earn praise for writing and directing the highly anticipated adaptation of ""Jack Reacher"" (2012) and ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" (2015). Whether behind the camera or the keyboard, McQuarrie's gift for telling unique stories and redefining genre tropes remained the one constant in his otherwise turbulent career."

Abrams created some of television's most watched shows while simultaneously making huge blockbuster movies. Though he had a rather inauspicious start writing the scripts for ""Taking Care of Business"" (1990) and ""Regarding Henry"" (1991), Abrams made his first dent in the cultural zeitgeist with the hit drama ""Felicity"" (The WB, 1998-2002). Abrams truly began making his mark with the spy drama ""Alias"" (ABC, 2001-06), which turned lead actress Jennifer Garner into a star and helped resurrect a foundering ABC network. He went on to help create the cult phenomenon ""Lost"" (ABC, 2004-2010), a mysterious sci-fi thriller wrapped inside a stirring character drama that attracted a loyal audience, all of whom tried to decipher the previous night's episode. When he left the series during the height of its run, Abrams ventured into feature film directing with the well-received ""Mission: Impossible III"" (2006). He also paid homage to the classic '80s films of his hero Steven Spielberg with ""Super 8"" (2011), which audiences and critics hailed as one of Abrams' most engaging efforts in a career already rife with crowd-pleasing entertainment. It was his reboot of the famed franchise ""Star Trek"" (2009) that launched his blockbuster career in earnest and foretold of even greater things to come, including the 2013 announcement that he landed the coveted director's job on ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), which went on to overtake ""Avatar"" (2009) as the highest-grossing film in history (not adjusted for inflation). In September 2017, Abrams' return to the Star Wars universe was confirmed when it was announced that he would replace the departing Colin Trevorrow as writer and director of 2019's ""Star Wars Episode IX."""

Aside from a small role in ""Malcolm X"" (1992), starring his father in the title role, the younger Washington avoided the glitz and glamour of the Hollywood spotlight, instead focusing his attention on athletics. After lettering in football, baseball, and track at Campbell Hall High School in Los Angeles, Washington attended his father's alma mater, Morehouse College, on a football scholarship. As a running back at Morehouse, he set school records for yards in a career, season, and single game and led his conference in rushing in 2005. Undrafted in the 2006 draft, Washington was signed by the St. Louis Rams, eventually ending up on their practice squad. After stints in the NFL Europe and the short-lived United Football League, Washington finally came back to Hollywood, first as a co-producer on ""The Book of Eli"" (2010) starring his father and directed by Allen and Albert Hughes. Washington's first professional work in front of the camera during his adult life came in 2015 when he landed a role as a series regular on ""Ballers"" (HBO, 2015-).

Edgar"" (2011). But it was his performance on the buzzy, bruising ""Girls"" (HBO, 2012-17) as Adam Sackler, Lena Dunham's emotionally complicated boyfriend, that brought him into the spotlight. Big-screen roles in Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" (2012), the Coen Brothers' folk-scene homage ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (2013), and Noah Baumbach's indie hit ""Frances Ha"" (2012) ensured he stayed there. While his nuanced performance as Kylo Ren in the much-anticipated ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015) and ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017) brought Driver to a whole new level of international superstardom, his work in smaller films like Jim Jarmusch's ""Paterson"" (2016), Baumbach's ""The Meyerowitz Stories"" (2017), Steven Soderbergh's ""Logan Lucky"" (2017) and Spike Lee's ""Black Klansman"" (2018) kept him true to his indie roots.

Born in Chicago and raised in Evanston, Illinois, Harrier became an actress by accident. After moving to New York City at 18 to attend NYU, Harrier started working as a professional model. She never saw modeling as a sustainable career path, but before long she was landing work for such high-profile companies as Urban Outfitters and American Eagle. Eventually, Harrier decided to drop out of NYU to pursue modeling full-time. By her early 20s, Harrier's modeling career was in full-swing and it was around that time that she became interested in acting. Since she was living in New York, Harrier began taking classes at the William Esper studio on a whim. She soon realized that acting was her calling and began devoting more and more time to learning her craft. By the early 2010s Harrier was going out on film and TV auditions and in 2013 landed her first big break with the reboot of ""One Life to Live"" (TOLN, 2013). She played Destiny Evans on the rebooted soap opera, which ran for 43 episodes on The Online Network, before it was cancelled. Undeterred, she continued auditioning and in 2014 landed a small part in the musical-comedy ""The Last Five Years"" (2014). She followed that role up with a role in the comedy-drama ""Fourth Man Out"" in 2015, thus adding another mainstream film role to her growing acting resume.

Born in New York City and raised in Darien, Connecticut, Grace first started acting while attending boarding school in New Hampshire. He began appearing in school productions of famous musicals like ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,"" and quickly fell in love with acting. It was also during this period that Grace, whose first name is Christopher, started calling himself Topher, seeing as he hated it when people called him Chris. When he was just starting out as a stage actor, Grace met a young actress by the name of Chloe Sevigny (who would later go on to have a sterling acting career in her own right). Grace and Sevigny appeared in a few plays together, and although she was only a few years older than him, she eventually babysat for the younger Topher on a few occasions. By the time he was 18, Grace knew that he wanted to be in films and on TV. He enrolled in the University of Southern California, given its close proximity to Hollywood, and began going on auditions in between classes. On one of his very first auditions, he was asked to read for the part of a new sitcom that took place in the 1970s. Grace crushed the audition and was given the role of the lovable, but slightly socially awkward teenager Eric Forman on ""That 70's Show."" When the show premiered in 1998, it was a big hit, making instant stars of Grace and his fellow castmates, which included Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. By the early 2000s, with his career in the sitcom world riding high, Grace also started making a name for himself in movies. In the first few years of the 2000s, Grace racked up roles in ""Traffic"" (2000), ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001), ""Mona Lisa Smile"" (2003) and ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!"" (2004), thus proving he had the serious acting chops needed to make it in movies. In 2005, after 7 seasons on ""That 70's Show,"" Grace left the series to focus on his burgeoning film career. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, he appeared as Venom in ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007), ""Predators"" (2010), ""Take Me Home Tonight"" (2011), ""The Big Wedding"" (2013), and ""Interstellar"" (2014). Then in 2018, Grace worked with the iconic director Spike Lee in ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018). He played the white supremacist David Duke in the film, which took home an Academy Award and also starred Adam Driver. In 2019, nearly 15 years after he left ""That 70's Show,"" Grace returned to TV with a starring role in the thriller mini-series ""The Hot Zone"" (National Geographic, 2019). That series, which also starred Julianna Margulies, premiered on the National Geographic channel in May of 2019."

After attending high school at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Hawkins moved to New York for college where he enrolled at Juilliard School, receiving the John Houseman Award for excellence in classical theatre during his studies there. He subsequently began his professional acting career, appearing on an episode of the science fiction series Futurestates (ITVS, 2010-).

He would appear alongside Liam Neeson in the thriller ""Non-Stop"" (2014) soon afterward, with his landmark role in ""Straight Outta Compton"" appearing shortly thereafter.

A respected authority on international folk music and a world-touring performer, Belafonte also enjoyed a career as an actor and producer, where he was involved in important early African-American productions including ""Carmen Jones"" (1954), in which he starred alongside Dorothy Dandridge, and Lorraine Hansberry's landmark play ""To Be Young, Gifted, and Black,"" which he produced.

347,Spike Lee,3/20/1957,"Atlanta, Georgia, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/YGEzILm7bMZEkg6Pca2a38rF3sg=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1001_v9_bb.jpg,"Spike Lee was an American director, writer, producer, and actor who was bar-none the pre-eminent chronicler of black life in America through the lens of independent film throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. Over a three decade-plus career, Lee's films, or ""joints"" as he often called them, were brazen cherry bombs aimed at mainstream society, tackling such thorny issues as racism, crime, poverty, media manipulation, and religion with style, grit, and urgency. Love him or hate him, Lee proved time and time again that you simply cannot discount him. Born Shelton Jackson Lee on March 20, 1957 in Atlanta, GA, Lee was raised in an artistically inclined, Afro-centric family. His mother, Jacqueline Carroll, was a professor of arts and black literature, while his father, William James Edward Lee III, was a jazz musician and composer, so it is perhaps no coincidence that Lee and all of his younger siblings would end up pursuing careers in the arts and taking part in his feature films: his brothers, David and CinquÃ©, grew up to become a photographer and an actor/filmmaker, respectively, while his sister, Joie, became a screenwriter, producer, and actress. After spending the first few years of his life in Georgia, Lee and his family moved to Brooklyn, New York, where he would spend his formative years. It was here that his mother nicknamed him ""Spike."" After attending John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, Lee enrolled in Morehouse College, a historically black university. While at Morehouse, Lee made his first student film, ""Last Hustle in Brooklyn"" (1977). He also took film courses at Clark Atlanta University, and eventually graduated from Morehouse with a B.A. in mass communication. Upon returning to NYC, Lee was accepted into the graduate film program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, where he earned a Master's degree in film & television. Lee's thesis film, ""Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads"" (1983) caused major waves, becoming the first student film to be showcased in Lincoln Center's prestigious New Directors/New Films Festival, and winning Lee the Student Academy Award. That same year, Lee founded his production company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, a portend of Lee's proclivity for provocation. In 1986, Lee released his debut feature, ""She's Gotta Have It"" (1986). Shot for a few thousand dollars in sultry black and white, and featuring a narrative device borrowed from Akira Kurosawa's classic ""Rashomon"" (1950), the film followed three young black men as they compared and contrasted their experiences dating the same woman. Critics were wowed by the film, and Lee was instantly pegged as a filmmaker to watch. His sophomore effort, ""School Daze"" (1988), was a dark comedy partially inspired by Lee's tenure at Morehouse College, which notably featured the first instance of what would become Lee's visual calling card, the so-called ""floating"" dolly shot. For his next film, Lee swung big, taking a look at one swelteringly hot day on one block in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bed-Stuy, as tensions between black residents and the white owners of a pizza joint reach a breaking point. ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989), was hailed as a masterpiece immediately upon its release, was a prime contender for the Palme d'Or at that year's Cannes Film Festival, and was predicted to be a major player in that year's Academy Awards. To the chagrin of many, ""Do the Right Thing"" was snubbed for a Best Picture nod, and Lee was shut out of the Best Director nominations, leaving him to make due with a Best Original Screenplay nomination. To add salt to the wound, Lee felt that that year's Best Picture winner, ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989), was based on safe racial stereotypes meant to coddle white people. As the nineties began, Lee went in to full-on prolific auteur mode: he would release one film a year for the entire decade, except for 1993. First up was ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990), in which Denzel Washington played a troubled jazz musician loosely based on Lee's father, beginning a fruitful collaborative partnership with the leading man. Next up was the interracial romantic comedy ""Jungle Fever"" (1991) starring Wesley Snipes, followed by the sprawling biopic ""Malcolm X"" (1992), in which Washington turned in a powerhouse performance as the civil rights activist. Critics praised the film as Lee's best, and one of the best films of the decade, but once again, the Academy shut him out: no Best Picture or Best Director nominations (and Washington lost Best Actor to Al Pacino's hammy, scenery-chewing turn in ""Scent of a Woman"" (1992)). Lee took 1993 off to get married to lawyer Tonya Lewis. In response to yet another snub, Lee turned out a trio of middlingly-received pulpy crime dramas: ""Crooklyn"" (1994), ""Clockers"" (1995), and ""Girl 6"" (1996), before releasing another civil rights epic, ""Get on the Bus"" (1996). Lee followed this up with his first documentary, ""4 Little Girls"" (1997), a probing documentary on the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, AL. This earned Lee his second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Documentary Feature. Lee's third collaboration with Washington, ""He Got Game"" (1998), was a sobering tale of black fatherhood and the escapism of basketball, while ""Summer of Sam"" (1999) was a bloated look at the tumultuous summer that overtook NYC in 1977. His first concert film ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" (2000), was better received than his next narrative film, ""Bamboozled"" (2000), a media satire shot for cheap on digital video about a modern televised minstrel show, which critics dismissed as impossibly broad and unrealistic (though today it looks prescient). Lee bounced back with another well-received documentary, ""Jim Brown: All-American"" (2002), as well as one of his most acclaimed narrative films, ""25th Hour"" (2002), in which he slyly transformed a tale of a convicted drug dealer (Edward Norton) experiencing his last day of freedom into a look at the post-9/11 grief and trauma that had engulfed all of New York City. In true Lee fashion, he then followed up one of his most acclaimed films with one of his most derided films, ""She Hate Me"" (2004), in which an enterprising young man starts a business impregnating wealthy lesbians. Critics savaged the film, and audiences stayed away. Luckily for Lee, the same could not be said for his next film, ""Inside Man"" (2006). A taught, socially conscious heist thriller starring Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and his longtime collaborator Washington, the film was a hit with both critics and audiences. ""When the Levees Broke"" (2006) was a sprawling, angry documentary look at the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, while the baffling WWII drama ""Miracle at St. Anna"" (2008) received perhaps the most scathing reviews of Lee's career. After revisiting the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina with the documentary ""If God Is Willing and da Creek Don't Rise"" (2010), and returning to his low-budget indie roots with the divisive coming of age drama ""Red Hook Summer"" (2012), Lee turned out a duo of ill-advised, underperforming genre film remakes: ""Oldboy"" (2013), a new take on Korean auteur Park Chan-wook's revenge saga, and ""Da Sweet Blood of Jesus"" (2014), based on Bill Gunn's hallucinatory, Afro-centric vampire romance, ""Ganja and Hess"" (1973). Lee got some of his groove back with ""Chi-Raq"" (2015), an ambitious update of the Classical Greek comedy ""Lysistrata"" set in modern-day Chicago, in which all of the characters spoke in rhyme. That same year, Lee was given an Academy Honorary Award for his contributions to film, usually a sign that an artist's glory days are behind themHowever, Lee proved he was still a vital force with his next film, ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018). Based on the true story of two police officers, one black (John David Washington, son of Denzel), and one white (Adam Driver) who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in 1970s Colorado Springs, the film told a highly entertaining story, while sucker punching audiences in it's final moments by drawing parallels to the current fraught political climate. Critics praised ""BlacKkKlansman"" as one of Lee's best, the film earned $90 million at the box office on a $15 million budget, and Lee was awarded the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Sweetest of all, however, was the fact that ""BlacKkKlansman"" finally earned Lee those elusive Oscar nods for Best Picture and Best Director."

The daughter of former ""NBC Nightly News"" (1970- ) anchor Brian Williams, Williams graduated from Yale, where she was a member of the improv troupe Just Add Water for four years. Although she had made two guest appearances on ""American Dreams"" (NBC, 2002-05) in 2004 and one on ""The League"" (FX, 2009-15) in 2011, Williams achieved wider success with a string of viral Internet videos, including writing a series of Funny or Die sketches that featured her as royal newlywed Kate Middleton. On the strength of her improv chops, Williams was tapped to audition for the Lena Dunham/Judd Apatow series ""Girls"" (HBO, 2012-17) and landed the role of Marnie Michaels, roommate and best friend to Hannah Horvath (Dunham), whose composed, polished exterior hides deep-seated insecurities. In December 2014, Williams starred in the title role of ""Peter Pan Live!"" (NBC 2014), a live TV adaptation of the beloved musical version of the J.M. Barrie tale. That same year, Williams co-starred in the indie romance ""College Musical"" (2014), continuing her streak of projects that showcase both her acting and singing abilities.

Aging gracefully into maternal roles, Keener continued alternating between lead roles in art house favorites such as Nicole Holofcener's ""Friends With Money"" (2006) and David Schwimmer's ""Trust"" (2010) and supporting roles in hits ranging from animated smash ""The Croods"" (2013) to Jordan Peele's horror hit ""Get Out"" (2017).

Prior to his seven season run on that beloved program, Whitford made a small name for himself, usually as an arrogant yuppie type in films like ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987) and ""Billy Madison"" (1995). He also excelled on the stage, delivering standout performances in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1988) and in the original production of ""A Few Good Men"" (1989), which introduced the actor to ""The West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin. In fact, Whitford became something of a Sorkin player, returning to star in the writer-playwright's critically acclaimed, but ultimately failed drama about the goings-on of a flailing late night sketch show, ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" (NBC, 2006-07). Whitford continued working steadily, starring on the sitcom ""Trophy Wife"" (ABC 2013-14) and appearing in the acclaimed comedy-drama ""Transparent"" (Amazon 2014- ), co-starring as Hubert Humphrey in the television movie ""All the Way"" (HBO 2015) and co-starring in Jordan Peele's critically-acclaimed horror hit ""Get Out"" (2017). Always one to talk about his political views, which were firmly planted on the liberal side of the spectrum, Whitford was often called upon to express his opinions on talk shows like ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" (HBO, 2003- ) and even co-host a radio talk show on Air America.

Born on December 7, 1989 in Garland, TX, Jones grew up in the nearby city of Richardson. From a young age, he began appearing in local productions, making his film debut in the Coen Brothers' Oscar winning southern noir, ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007), before taking cameo roles in ""Superbad"" (2007) and ""The Longshots"" (2008). That same year, Jones landed his first TV role with an arc on the acclaimed high school football drama ""Friday Night Lights"" (NBC, 2006-2011). Following this, Jones decided to move to Los Angeles and pursue acting seriously. After making appearances on ""Breaking Bad"" (AMC, 2008-2013) and ""Victorious"" (Nickelodeon, 2010-13), Jones was cast in his biggest role yet, playing Sean ""Banshee"" Cassidy in the superhero reboot ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011). Jones continued to appear in a wide array of movies, including Neil Jordan's romantic drama ""Byzantium"" (2012), Philip Seymour Hoffman's mob drama ""God's Pocket"" (2014), and Josh and Bennie Safdie's heroin addiction saga ""Heaven Knows What"" (2014). However, Jones's best professional year by far proved to be 2017, during which he appeared in a number of highly prestigious and successful projects, including Jordan Peele's satirical horror thriller ""Get Out"" (2017), Sean Baker's humanist dramedy ""The Florida Project"" (2017), Doug Liman's Tom Cruise-starring drug trade saga ""American Made"" (2017), and Martin Mcdonough's pitch-black crime comedy ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017), plus a four-episode arc on David Lynch and Mark Frost's highly acclaimed reboot ""Twin Peaks: The Return"" (Showtime, 2017-)."

Root's scene-stealing work went on to enhance a number of projects over the years, attracting the attention of such respected talents as the Coen Brothers, Mike Judge and George Clooney. Determined to avoid typecasting, Root made sure to regularly alternate between comedy and drama, and his experience in both disciplines, gained via years of work in regional theater and the National Shakespeare Company, provided him with an excellent skill set to portray a wide array of people, average and otherwise."

383,Robert De Niro,8/17/1943,"New York, New York, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/-viabJk_upfLPTpF8zf-MRZ_7tY=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/55052_v9_bc.jpg,"One of the most accomplished and respected actors of the 20th century and beyond, Oscar winner Robert De Niro was an intense and formidable presence in a string of acclaimed films directed by Martin Scorsese, including ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990), as well as such features as ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974), ""1900"" (1976), ""Heat"" (1995), ""Meet the Parents"" (2000) and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012). Born Robert Anthony De Niro, Jr., on August 17, 1943 in New York's Manhattan borough, he was the son of artists Robert De Niro, Sr., and Virginia Admiral, who divorced when their son was two years of age. He developed an interest in performing through visits to local movie houses with his father, and soon began acting in school productions while also receiving his earliest training at Maria Picator's Dramatic Workshop, where his mother worked as a typist and copyeditor.  De Niro briefly attended the High School of Music and Art but left in the ninth grade, citing a high level of competition and his own shyness. But after a cross-country trip to visit relatives in 1960, the 16-year-old De Niro decided to leave high school altogether and enroll at the Stella Adler Conservatory. After additional training with Lee Strasberg at the Actor's Studio, he began auditioning for film roles. Though he would make his screen acting debut in Brian De Palma's low-budget comedy ""The Wedding Party,"" the film would not be released until 1969, so his uncredited turn the French comedy ""Three Rooms in Manhattan"" (1965) would mark his actual film debut. Three years later, he reunited with De Palma for the bawdy freeform comedy ""Greetings"" (1968), which earned a Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. He bounced between arthouse and drive-in fare for his next few projects, teaming again with De Palma for ""Hi, Mom!"" (1970), a comedy about amateur pornographers, and playing a drug-addicted Depression Era gangster in Roger Corman's ""Bloody Mama"" (1970) before earning critical praise as a terminally ill baseball player in ""Bang the Drum Slowly"" (1973). That same year, he also starred as a dangerously off-kilter hood in ""Mean Streets"" (1973), which marked the beginning of his long and celebrated collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. The film would serve as a launching pad for a remarkable string of projects in the 1970s, beginning in 1974 with ""The Godfather Part II,"" which earned him an Oscar for his performance - entirely in Sicilian - as the young Vito Corleone. Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), which brought a second Oscar nomination for his turn as a psychotic who believed himself to be a criminal avenger, and Bernardo Bertolucci's ""1900"" (1976) soon followed, as did his thinly veiled portrait of studio head Irving Thalberg in Elia Kazan's ""The Last Tycoon"" (1976) and a third Oscar nod for Michael Cimino's harrowing Vietnam War drama ""The Deer Hunter"" (1979). After teaming with Scorsese for the period drama ""New York, New York"" (1977), the duo reunited again for ""Raging Bull"" (1980), a elegiac portrait of boxer Jake LaMotta; De Niro, who gained 60 pounds to portray LaMotta in his twilight years, earned a second Oscar for his intensely committed and rigorously physical performance. The dawn of the 1980s saw De Niro working with some of the most acclaimed filmmakers in the world, including the scabrous ""King of Comedy"" (1982) with Scorsese, the epic gangster film ""Once Upon a Time in America"" for Sergio Leone, the fantasy ""Brazil"" (1984) for Terry Gilliam, and the sweeping period drama ""The Mission"" (1985) for Roland Joffe. He then reunited with De Palma to play a malevolent Al Capone in the director's big-screen take of ""The Untouchables"" (1987) before dipping into mainstream waters as a foul-mouthed skip tracer in Martin Brest's popular action-comedy ""Midnight Run"" (1988). In the '90s, De Niro settled into a breathless schedule of acting roles in both studio and arthouse features. The most notable of these was his turn as an Irish mobster in an Italian crime family in Scorsese's celebrated ""Goodfellas"" (1990), as well as back-to-back Oscar nominations for Penny Marshall's ""Awakenings"" (1991), which cast him as a comatose patient revived by Dr. Oliver Sacks' experimental therapy, and Scorsese's remake of ""Cape Fear"" (1992), with De Niro as a feral criminal pursuing lawyer Nick Nolte's family. Between these efforts were collaborations with Martin Ritt and Jane Fonda in ""Stanley & Iris"" (1990), Ron Howard on the firefighter drama ""Backdraft"" (1991),  Bill Murray in John McNaughton's ""Mad Dog and Glory"" (1993), and Kenneth Branagh, who cast him as the Monster in ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994). De Niro also found time during this period to make his directorial debut with ""A Bronx Tale"" (1993), a sentimental period piece based on co-star Chazz Palminteri's nostalgic one-man show, and a reunion with Scorsese and frequent co-star Joe Pesci for ""Casino"" (1995), a story of organized crime in Las Vegas. He would cap the decade with several high-quality projects, including a supporting turn for Quentin Tarantino in ""Jackie Brown"" (1997) and a lead in two superlative caper films, John Frankenheimer's ""Ronin"" (1998) and Michael Mann's ""Heat"" (1995). But with the turn of the new millennium, De Niro's screen output appeared to take a decidedly downward turn. Critics and fans of his early work were dismayed to see appear in lackluster comedies like ""Showtime"" (2002) with Eddie Murphy and wan thrillers like ""Godsend"" (2004) and ""Righteous Kill"" (2008) with Al Pacino, and bemoaned the broad comedy ""Meet the Parents"" (2000), which cast him as a spymaster and strict father determined to undermine new son-in-law Ben Stiller, and its sequels ""Meet the Fockers"" (2004) and ""Little Fockers"" (2010). In truth, De Niro's prodigious output during this period also included a number of well-received and popular films, including the thriller ""City by the Sea"" (2002) and a second directorial effort with the espionage drama ""The Good Shepherd"" (2006), as a producer, oversaw the ""Fockers"" films, ""About a Boy"" (2002) and ""Rent"" (2005) through his TriBeCa Productions. But the sheer number of forgettable films in his c.v. during the 2000s undermined - at least in the eyes of some fans and reviewers - his more celebrated titles. For this demographic, De Niro rebounded with solid character turns in three films for David O. Russell: the quirky ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012), which earned him a fifth Oscar nomination, his '70s New York drama ""American Hustle"" (2013) and the rags-to-riches comedy ""Joy"" (2015). After a spate of largely unremarkable features, De Niro capped 2019 with major roles in two high-profile features: the Cannes hit ""Joker"" (2019), with Joaquin Phoenix as the DC villain and De Niro as a merciless talk show host, and ""The Irishman"" (2019), a reunion with Scorsese, Pacino and Pesci based on the real-life story of Frank Sheeran, who was allegedly responsible for the disappearance of labor chief Jimmy Hoffa."

Coming to prominence during the New Hollywood golden age of the early 1970s, he possessed none of the classic features of leading men from Tinseltown's previous heydays, but enthralled audiences with absorbing performances on screens both large and small. As a Method actor, Pacino revealed the dark complexities of characters like Frank Serpico, Sonny Wortzik and Colonel Frank Slade. But in life, the actor remained an elusive figure, preferring to avoid disclosing anything of a personal nature. Despite such reluctance to open up about his life, Pacino maintained a long, prominent career in which he accomplished acting's rarest of feats - winning Oscar, Emmy and Tony awards. Although critics of his later films sometimes complained that Pacino coasted on accumulated goodwill from his powerful early work, performances ranging from his Shylock in Michael Radford's ""The Merchant of Venice"" (2004) to controversial assisted-suicide advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian in Barry Levinson's ""You Don't Know Jack"" (HBO 2010) and troubled record producer Phil Spector in David Mamet's ""Phil Spector"" (HBO 2013) revealed an actor able to slip in and out of wildly different characters."
385,Joe Pesci,2/9/1943,"Newark, New Jersey, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/vyHS8GbFE3ZALrahkHayGiePY1Q=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/1339_v9_bb.jpg,"Joe Pesci was an American actor who was best known for playing loose-cannon tough guys and cold-hearted mobsters in a string of critically-acclaimed films, including ""Raging Bull"" (1980), ""Goodfellas"" (1990), and ""Casino"" (1995). Pesci was born into a working class Italian-American family in Newark, New Jersey, and was raised in Belleville. As a teenager he was friends with the singers Frankie Valli and Tom DeVito, and played a small role in the later formation of their band The Four Seasons. Valli and DeVito formed The Four Seasons after Pesci introduced them to the and songwriter Bob Gaudio, who would later write several of the group's best known songs. Having always had an interest in music himself, Pesci embarked on a career as a singer in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Together, along with Frank Vincent, who would later become a notable actor in his own right for playing the New York mob boss Frank Leotardo on ""The Sopranos"" (HBO, 1999-2007), the two men, who billed themselves as Vincent and Pesci, would perform at clubs all around North Jersey. In addition to performing songs, Vincent and Pesci also performed comedy on stage. In 1976 Pesci made his film acting debut by starring in the low-budget crime drama ""The Death Collector"" (1976). Pesci's performance in the film, which also starred Vincent, was widely praised, but it didn't do anything to advance Pesci's acting career at the time. Shortly after the film was released, Pesci, who was in his mid-30s at the time, went back to living in the same tiny Bronx apartment above the Italian restaurant he worked in. Then, three years after ""The Death Collector"" was released, Pesci received a phone call that would change his life. The call was from director Martin Scorsese. He told Pesci that Robert De Niro had saw him in ""The Death Collector"" and suggested Pesci co-star in his upcoming movie ""Raging Bull."" Pesci agreed. His riveting performance as Joey LaMotta, the cool-headed brother to De Niro's volatile Jake La Motta, earned Pesci an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Upon the film's release in 1980, critics were already calling it one of the greatest sports films ever made. But in the decades since it wowed audiences and critics, ""Raging Bull"" has gone on to be included in several lists of the greatest films ever made, thanks in part to Pesci and De Niro's riveting performances. After the massive success of ""Raging Bull,"" Pesci went onto appear in a number of other films throughout the 1980s, including ""Easy Money"" (1983), ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984), and ""Lethal Weapon 2"" (1989), the latter of which featured Pesci in the comedic role of Leo Getz. Pesci would later go on to reprise the much beloved Leo Getz role in two additional sequels: ""Lethal Weapon 3"" (1992) and ""Lethal Weapon 4"" (1998). In 1990 Pesci reteamed with De Niro and Scorsese to play the hot-headed gangster Tommy DeVito in ""Goodfellas"" (1990). Once again, Pesci's performance earned him widespread praise from fans and critics, and at the 1991 Academy Awards he took home his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. By the 1990s, Pesci began showing off his versatility by appearing in a number of crowd-pleasing comedies, including ""Home Alone"" (1990), ""My Cousin Vinny"" (1992), ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" (1992), and ""8 Heads in a Duffel Bag"" (1997). Pesci reteamed with Scorsese and De Niro for a third time in the director's epic Las Vegas movie ""Casino"" (1995). Although Pesci and De Niro once again earned widespread acclaim for their performances, only Sharon Stone, who played De Niro's boozy hustler of a wife in the film, earned an Oscar nod. In 1999 Pesci announced his retirement from acting so that he could focus on one of his first loves: making music. He did, however, return to acting in 2006 to appear in the De Niro-directed spy film ""The Good Shepherd,"" and later went on to co-star in the 2010 comedy ""The Love Ranch."" Then in 2019 Pesci reteamed with his old pals De Niro and Scorsese for a fourth time in the epic gangster film ""The Irishman.""

Movieg rs were thankful for her later change of heart, as the Canadian actress continued to give thoughtful, complex and occasionally seductive turns as an adult in a wide variety of projects ranging from big-budget blockbusters like the ""X-Men"" franchise to independent fare like Noah Bambauch's ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005). But it was her foray onto the small screen that allowed for her most compelling performances, particularly as a 19th-century schoolteacher who campaigns for Native American rights in the Emmy-winning miniseries, ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"" (HBO, 2007), for which she received Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. Paquin also shined in her first regular series television role, playing barmaid and telepath Sookie Stackhouse on Alan Ball's acclaimed ""True Blood"" (HBO, 2008-14), which only added to an already impressive career for the young actress."

His prolific but slow-to-ignite career began with memorably unlikable supporting roles in Martin Scorsese character studies ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) and ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" (1974), though he turned to European films shortly thereafter when he failed to find a suitable place in mainstream films. An Academy-Award nominated supporting role in ""Bugsy"" (1991) heralded a new beginning for Keitel on American soil, and he became a favorite on the indie film scene of the 1990s through his association with Quentin Tarantino cult classics ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). Keitel had several successes when he chose to tap his inner soft side, like in Jane Campion's ""The Piano"" (1993), but by far, he was the go-to guy for potentially explosive everymen, grizzled police force veterans and G-men in both subtle indies and gun-blazing big budget adventures alike."

The British actor first came to prominence when he was cast as Tommy, the dim-witted, wannabe thug in Guy Ritchie's off-beat crime film, ""Snatch"" (2000), The talented actor also impressed critics with his hard-hitting performance in the Martin Scorsese-helmed film, ""Gangs of New York"" (2002) about the Irish immigrants who went to New York City in the mid-19th century and the gang wars that erupted between them and the American patriots. Graham's authentic tough-guy persona also landed him a career-defining role in the epic gangster film ""Public Enemies"" (2009), alongside Johnny Depp as the enigmatic bank robber John Dillinger. Graham's unhinged portrayal of the sociopathic Chicago mobster Baby Face Nelson in this unlikely summer hit earned him worldwide acclaim and launched the multi-dimensional actor as a bona fide movie star."

But while he certainly scored as ""regular Joes"" - including his charming work in the indie favorite ""The Station Agent"" (2003) - he easily adapted into a wide range of characters and consistently enjoyed cross-medium success that few actors could match. In fact, he translated his easygoing appeal across a wide spectrum of projects like ""Snakes on a Plane"" (2005) and ""Fast Food Nation"" (2006), while also appearing steadily on stage with roles in ""Mauritius"" (2008), ""The Talk"" (2008) and ""The Motherf**ker with the Hat"" (2011).

Lombardozzi played Detective Thomas ""Herc"" Hauk, a no-nonsense lawman whose punch-first-ask-questions-later style frequently landed him in hot water. The role was the high point of a two-decade career that began with ""A Bronx Tale"" (1993) when Lombardozzi was a teenager, and soon included appearances on ""Oz"" (HBO, 1997-2003) and ""61*"" (HBO, 2001), among other projects. After ""The Wire,"" Lombardozzi found himself essaying more cops and gunmen in bigger projects like ""Miami Vice"" (2006) and ""Public Enemies"" (2009) before earning his first turn as a series lead in ""Breakout Kings"" (A&E, 2011-12). The action-drama allowed Lombardozzi to play to his strengths - innate street sense and physical prowess - while imbuing his character with a layer of sensitivity as a caring father.

When he translated that accessible, everyday-guy persona into a sitcom, he made television history with ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" (CBS, 1996-2005), one of the best-loved, most critically acclaimed sitcoms of the era. A Top 10 ratings earner for over half of its nine-year run, the show's success was rooted in its outstanding ensemble cast and its relatable focus on the minutiae of family life, with adults taking center stage. The show transformed Romano into one of the top TV stars of the day, with a best-selling memoir and a Grammy-nominated comedy album to complete the picture. When he ventured out onto the big screen, however, it was hit-or-miss, with several failed attempts at buddy comedies and darker independent films but blockbuster success arrived in the shape of Manny, the wooly mammoth who Romano amusingly voiced in the animated ""Ice Age"" franchise. In the wake of nearly a decade spent on the CBS sitcom he created, Romano branched out in 2009 with another primetime project, ""Men of a Certain Age"" (TNT, 2009-11). The hourlong comic drama proved that Romano could ably inhabit less autobiographical material than his previous hit, yet still draw in audiences with his intensely likable persona and timeless wit."

His impressive body of work was a meditation on the visceral nature of violence and male relationships that often reflected his own personal angst growing up in the violent streets of Manhattan's Lower East Side. Starting with ""Mean Streets"" (1973), a gritty look at life in Little Italy, Scorsese made his mark on Hollywood while simultaneously discarding many of its conventions. With his seminal films ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) and ""Raging Bull"" (1980), Scorsese firmly established himself as a top director of his generation. Though he hit a brief creative lull in the 1980s, films like ""After Hours"" (1985), ""The Color of Money"" (1986) and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988) would have been welcome additions on any director's rÃ©sumÃ©. He returned to top form with the hyperkinetic mob tale, ""Goodfellas"" (1990), widely considered by fans to be among his best films.

After starting out on a number of Spanish-language shorts and features, the Mexican-born cinematographer broke onto the international scene with 2000's ""Amores Perros,"" crafting both grittily realistic and dreamlike imagery for three intertwining tales of love and animals. The film also proved a major hit and breakthrough for director Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, and all three continued to work together afterward. Their other collaborations included ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel,"" released in 2003 and 2006, respectively, to much critical acclaim. Around this time, Prieto also became acquainted with well-known directors such as Spike Lee, Curtis Hanson, and Ang Lee, although the types of projects varied. For Spike Lee and Hanson, he served as cinematographer on ""25th Hour"" and ""8 Mile,"" both dramas in urban settings. Meanwhile, Ang Lee recruited him to highlight the natural splendor of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" which helped give the two main characters' relationship a layer of joyfulness and innocence. For his work on the film, Prieto garnered his first Academy Award nomination. He also collaborated with Oliver Stone on the 2004 biopic ""Alexander,"" his 2010 drama ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"" and his documentaries of Fidel Castro and Yassir Arafat, showing himself willing to embrace politically-charged and potentially incendiary material."

His impressions and ability to stay in character impressed his friends and family, and after his sister went to study acting in New York, her younger brother followed. A devoted student of Stella Adler and the Stanislavsky system, Brando worked to fully embody his roles, both psychologically and physically. The erratic behavior encouraged by the system caused many to distance themselves from the young actor, but as he developed, Brando began to turn in some revelatory performances. In 1946, Brando starred in the Broadway production of ""Truckline CafÃ©,"" which earned him the title of ""Most Promising Young Actor"" by the New York Drama Critics. The play was also his first professional collaboration with legendary director and producer Elia Kazan. The two collaborated again on Broadway, with Kazan directing and Brando starring in Tennessee Williams play ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" in 1947. Brando's first screen appearance came in ""The Men"" (1950). The next year he reprised his role as Stanley Kowalski in the filmed version of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) also directed by Elia Kazan. His performance was electric, earning Brando his first Academy Award nomination, and immediately vaulted him to the status of screen idol. Two years later he starred in the iconic motorcycle drama ""The Wild One"" (1953). He was nominated for another Academy Award for Best Actor in 1952 for his performance in ""Viva Zapata"" (1952), the next year for his performance as Mark Antony in ""Julius Caesar"" (1953). Brando and Kazan had another successful collaboration in ""On the Waterfront"" (1954). The film was nominated for twelve Academy Awards (with three actors from the film nominated for Best Supporting Actor), and won eight, including Brando for Best Actor. Brando took a swing at a musical when he starred with Jean Simmons in ""Guys and Dolls"" (1955). Although his singing was routinely panned, the film was a financial success. He directed ""One Eyed Jacks"" (1961), a western in which he also starred, taking over the reins from Stanley Kubrick at the behest of the studio. Through the 1960s Brando continued to star in films, but none lived up to the promise of his early career. In 1972, Brando put in yet another iconic performance as the title character in ""The Godfather"" (1972), directed by Francis Ford Coppola and frequently considered one of the best films of all time. The performance earned him another Academy Award for Best Actor, which he famously declined to accept in person, instead sending a Native American rights activist in his place. The next year, Brando gained high marks for his performance in the controversial ""Last Tango in Paris"" (1973), and earned another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Brando played a small supporting role in ""Superman: The Movie"" (1978), earning nearly $4 million, making him the highest paid actor of all time per minute of screen time up to that date. The next year, he reunited with Coppola and starred in ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and one of the most memorable filmed portrayals of the Vietnam War. Brando continued to act in films, but never regained his former luster, although he turned in a memorable comic performance in ""The Freshman"" (1990), playing a lighter version of his character from ""The Godfather"" to much acclaim. In failing health for a number of years, Brando died in 2004, heralded as one of America's most influential cultural icons of the 20th Century."

Caan emerged from the cauldron of New York City's thriving acting scene in the 1950s to become a noted player on the stage and on television. Though he graduated to films soon after his salad days in New York after swearing off television for the next several years, he had his first big breakthrough on the small screen, playing dying football player Brian Piccolo in ""Brian's Song"" (ABC, 1971). His performance in what was considered to be one of the best television movies ever made earned Caan considerable acclaim, as well as an Emmy Award nomination. But the following year put Caan on the map permanently, with his energetic portrayal of the hot-headed Sonny Corleone in ""The Godfather"" (1972), a role with which he was forever identified - most notably in the numerous mobster roles he played in the ensuing decades."

Making his acclaimed debut at 31 years old as Arthur ""Boo"" Radley in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962), Duvall was a decade older when he played Tom Hagen, valued consigliere and adopted son of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in ""The Godfather"" (1972) and ""The Godfather, Part II"" (1974). While not exactly matinee idol material, he unquestionably possessed a wide range that allowed him to play bullying corporate executive Frank Hackett in ""Network"" (1976), self-determined surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), and hard-nosed Marine officer Bull Meechum in ""The Great Santini"" (1979). In the following decade, he won an Oscar for his performance as a washed-up country singer in ""Tender Mercies"" (1983), before playing a sportswriter in ""The Natural"" (1984) and a veteran cop in ""Colors"" (1988). On television, Duvall earned awards for turns as Gus McRae in ""Lonesome Dove"" (CBS, 1989) and Joseph Stalin in ""Stalin"" (HBO, 1992), though he stepped back into supporting roles on film with ""Sling Blade"" (1996). He earned acclaim for directing ""The Apostle"" (1997), while turns in the Westerns ""Open Range"" (2003) and ""Broken Trail"" (AMC, 2006) only bolstered his reputation.

Variously touted by the studio publicity machine as ""The Most Beautiful Man in Movies"" or ""The Beautiful Blond Viking God,"" the actor broke his contract in 1941 to join the Marines. During WWII, he assisted the Yugoslavian partisans fight against the Germans and briefly joined the Communist Party in 1946 (resigning after six months) before resuming his acting career the following year. Shortly after his superb performance in ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950), Hayden was gray-listed and was unable to work in Hollywood for six months. He then privately called on the FBI to make a statement concerning his former Communist affiliations, but was subpoenaed by HUAC in 1951 and obliged to testify in public, naming his fellow believers. Hayden was then allowed to continue working, though he expressed his guilt over having ""named names"" in his 1966 autobiography, ""Wanderer."" Ironically, in Stanley Kubrick's classic comedy ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1963), Hayden played the deranged General Jack D. Ripper, whose over-zealous desire to stop the ""communist threat"" sets World War III in motion. Among his other memorable roles were the corrupt police captain in ""The Godfather"" (1972) and the chairman of the board in the comedy ""9 to 5"" (1980).

Instead, he pursued a variety of business opportunities before being cast as Carlo Rizzi in ""The Godfather."" Some claim that he got the role by acting as an intermediary between Paramount Pictures and Mafia don Joe Colombo Sr., who had shut down production in New York.

Born Maria Grazia Morgana Messina on June 4, 1930, in Pleasantville, NY, King was raised in New York City, along with her five siblings. When she was thirteen, King's skills as a vocalist were recognized when she was overheard singing the aria ""I'll See You Again"" from the NoÃ«l Coward operetta ""Bitter Sweet."" Soon after, she was awarded a scholarship to the Metropolitan School of Music, where she developed a love for big band music. She began performing professionally under the name Morgana King at the age of sixteen, and became a fixture in the Greenwich Village music scene, wowing audiences with her unique phrasing and four-octave contralto range. At the age of 17, she married jazz trumpeter Tony Fruscella, who introduced her to a number of luminaries of the scene, including Charlie Parker, with whom the couple would often share Sunday dinner. King gave birth to her only child, Graysan, three years into the relationship. After a performance in 1953, a record executive from Emarcy Records, a subsidiary of Mercury, took interest in her, and in 1956, she released her debut album, For You, For Me, For Evermore. Sadly, she and Fruscella divorced that same year. King, however, kept busy with her career, recording and performing live at a furious pace, and often appearing on TV talk and variety shows. In 1960, King met jazz trombonist Willie Dennis at Charlie Parker's Birdland Jazz Club. Dennis invited King to accompany him on a tour of Brazil with Buddy Rich, a trip that King would later describe as ""an introduction to myself."" The couple married in 1961, but their relationship would meet a tragic end just four years later, when Dennis was killed in a car accident in Central Park. A devastated King left New York for Malibu, CA, and signed a three record contract with Reprise Records, the subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records founded by Frank Sinatra. Her first album for the label, It's A Quiet Thing, was a memorial in honor of Dennis. As the 60s turned into the 70s, King decided to try her hand at acting. Luckily, her first role was in one of the all-time greats: she was cast as Carmela Corleone, the loving and supportive wife to Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone, in Francis Ford Coppola's mafia epic, ""The Godfather"" (1972). The film won Best Picture at the Oscars, and became an instant classic. King reprised the role two years later for ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974), an even more epic film which won even more Oscars. King continued acting and performing throughout the 70s and 80s, before announcing her retirement from live concerts in 1993, though she would keep putting out records. Her final film appearance was in ""A Brooklyn State of Mind"" (1997). King enjoyed two decades of retirement in Palm Springs, CA, until she died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on March 22, 2018. She was 87 years old."

Known primarily for his successful ""Godfather"" trilogy - ""The Godfather"" (1972), ""The Godfather, Part II"" (1974) and ""The Godfather, Part III"" (1990) - Coppola was the most celebrated of the Young Turks - a group of filmmakers who emerged in the early 1970s that included George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma and William Friedkin. Unbridled by his ambition and enthusiasm, and perhaps obsessive to the point of being manic, Coppola infused a fervent creative energy into his early work, culminating in ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), a journey into his own heart of darkness that irrevocably altered his career and may have even caused permanent psychological damage. Renowned for his generosity with other filmmakers, Coppola served as a fierce promoter of others' films, championing the work of Wim Wenders, Paul Schrader and Akira Kurosawa, while playing an important part in the restoration of Abel Gance's classic silent film, ""Napoleon"" (1927). The quality of his directing fell off throughout the 1980s and 1990s, however, and the big studios - remembering his colossal box-office failures - became leery of backing his more personal projects, preferring instead to employ him as a hired gun on the likes of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) and  ""The Rainmaker"" (1997), which helped the director pay off his enormous debts. Nonetheless, Coppola - having been responsible for directing three of the greatest films in cinema history - remained forever a legend."

Working in close collaboration with Coppola, Puzo won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay and repeated the feat two years later with the sequel ""The Godfather, Part II"" (1974), which some considered superior to its predecessor. Because of the success of the novel and the two films, Puzo finally found the financial success he had long craved. He went on to write the scripts for ""Superman"" (1978) and ""Superman II"" (1980), and received a cool $1 million to write Coppola's film ""The Cotton Club"" (1984). Following a near fatal heart attack in 1991, Puzo rebounded with The Last Don (1996), which was turned into a CBS miniseries starring Danny Aiello. While that proved to be the last major success he saw during his lifetime, Puzo nonetheless was remembered for almost single-handedly bringing the Mafia to the forefront of popular culture."

A classically trained composer, Rota's career began in earnest in the early 1940s and lasted until his death in 1979. During that period he wrote 176 film scores, including several for the celebrated Italian film director Federico Fellini. In addition to the first two ""Godfather"" films, the second of which earned him an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1975, some of Rota's more notable works included ""The White Sheik"" (1952), ""La Strada"" (1954), and ""8 1/2"" (1963), all three of which were directed by Fellini.

After military service, he worked in NYC as a cameraman on documentaries and commercials before getting his first opportunity to work as cinematographer on Aram Avakian's ""The End of the Road"" (1970, adapted from the novel by John Barth), for which he attracted some attention with the tour-de-force psychedelic montages he managed to execute at minimal expense. Though he drew praise for his color lensing on Hal Ashby's flashy directorial debut ""The Landlord"" (also 1970) and for his artfully composed shots in ""Klute"" (1971, his first of six collaborations with Alan J. Pakula) which masked off much of the frame width to emphasize a point, he first came to prominence for his contribution to Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) and ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974). Although Willis retired in the late 1990s, he remained so respected among cinema fans that his 2014 death brought a slew of tributes and remembrances."

With this trifecta of projects, he found himself vaulted from rising U.K. heartthrob to Hollywood breakout-star-in-the-making. A native of suburban London, Hardy stumbled through an adolescence of recidivist juvenile delinquency and drug addiction to channel his energies into drama. He won some high-profile early acting jobs, seeing his first major screen time in the youthful ensemble of the epic HBO miniseries, ""Band of Brothers"" (2001), and turning in an intense performance as the intergalactic villain in ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002).

Born in South Africa, she originally moved with her mother to Milan, Italy to accept a modeling contract when she was 16. She relocated again to the United States to study dance. After an injury derailed her dancing career, she moved again to Los Angeles, and began an acting career. A small role as a lingerie-clad assassin in ""2 Days in the Valley"" (1996) brought her immediate notice. She was cast by Tom Hanks in ""That Thing You Do!"" (1997) and in the comedy ""Trial and Error"" (1997), before progressing quickly into high profile starring roles. Playing opposite Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino, she gained notice in Taylor Hackford's ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997), as the possessed wife of Reeves' lawyer. She soon headlined her own film when she was cast as the lead in Disney's remake of ""Mighty Joe Young"" (1998). She continued working steadily, starring opposite Tobey Maguire in ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999) and Ben Affleck in the action film ""Reindeer Games"" (2000), but she began slotting into roles that played upon her fresh-faced beauty. After a role in the well-received action yarn ""The Italian Job"" (2003), she took a role that completely changed perceptions of her. As serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Patty Jenkins' ""Monster"" (2003), the actress undertook a transformation that left her almost unrecognizable. She earned critical praise for the role, and took home both an Oscar and a Golden Globe. She followed up with dramatic roles in ""Head in the Cloud"" (2004) and ""North Country"" (2005), picking up a second Academy Award nomination for the latter. Despite good reviews the films didn't make quite the same impression as ""Monster."" Similarly, her work in the effects heavy films ""Aeon Flux"" (2005) and ""Hancock"" (2008), with Will Smith, also fell short of expectations. The actress fared better with a brief foray into television with a memorable guest arc on the hit comedy ""Arrested Development"" (Fox, 2003-06) and appearing as actress Britt Ekland opposite Geoffrey Rush in ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" (HBO, 2004).. She began another upward ascent with a role opposite Viggo Mortensen in the adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's post-apocalyptic drama ""The Road"" (2009). A fruitful partnership with screenwriter Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman emerged soon after, resulting in the well-received ""Young Adult"" (2011). The trio would later reform for ""Tully"" (2018). She also joined Chris Hemsworth for the fantasy adventures ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (2012) and ""The Huntsman: Winter's War"" (2016), playing sinister fairy tale villain Queen Ravenna. Her action bona fides were proven conclusively when she starred in George Miller's ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015), where she played the road warrior Imperator Furiosa. She followed that with a showy role as special agent Lorraine Broughton in ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017). The actress also joined one of history's most successful film franchises, playing the villainous Cipher in ""The Fate of the Furious"" (2017) and ""Fast & Furious 9"" (2020). Never one to be pigeonholed, she continued working in comedy as well, starring with Seth MacFarlane in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" (2014) and Seth Rogen in the romantic comedy ""Longshot"" (2019), the latter of which was under the banner of her own production company."

He also appeared in actor Richard E. Grant's semi-autobiographical film ""Wah-Wah"" (2005) and as Nicholas Cage's son in ""The Weather Man"" (2005). He began moving into more adult roles when he was cast in the remake of the fantasy film ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010). He gained notice throughout the film industry when he appeared as the gay college student helping Colin Firth's professor deal with the loss of his longtime companion in ""A Single Man"" (2009).

While her mother remained in the headlines throughout her youth, which included marriages to Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage, Keough was mostly shielded from the rash of paparazzi and tabloids. She made her acting debut in ""The Runaways"" (2010) alongside Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart. The next year, Keough appeared alongside Orlando Bloom and Taraji P. Henson in ""The Good Doctor"" (2011), receiving accolades for her roles as a distressed patient. Her first leading role was ""Jack & Diane,"" a maligned film where she played the love interest to Juno Temple. She began working with director Steven Soderbergh with a role in ""Magic Mike"" (2012), and with her profile being a little larger, she wound up entering the world of modeling, mostly due to work with the the fashion company Bonds. Her work with modeling led to her not acting much in 2013 and 2014, with her most notable credit being a Justin Timberlake music video. In 2015, though, Keough began to act more often, with her highest profile work in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015). She also starred in ""Dixieland"" (2015), ""Lovesong"" (2016), and ""We Don't Belong Here"" (2016) at this time. Keough reunited with Soderbergh for the lead role in the TV drama ""The Girlfriend Experience"" (Starz 2016- ), based on the director's 2009 film about the escort service industry."

Born Abbey Lee Kershaw in Melbourne, Australia on June 12, 1987, Lee was the daughter of professional football player Kim Kershaw and his wife, Kerry, a psychologist. Health issues plagued her childhood, including bouts of meningitis, but she bloomed in her teenaged years and after graduating from the Academy of Mary Immaculate in Fitzroy, she moved to Sydney to pursue a career in modeling. Lee was discovered by Chic Management's Kathy Ward in 2005, and remained with the agency until moving to Next Management and relocating to New York City in 2007. Once in the States, Lee became a staple of Fashion Weeks in New York and Milan, as well as a familiar face on the covers and in the pages of V, Australian Vogue and other publications. She also modeled for a number of major companies, including Victoria's Secret, Chanel and Gucci, all of which contributed to her coronation as the latest ""supermodel"" by V in 2011. The following year, Lee scaled back her modeling career to focus on acting, which began in earnest with a supporting role as one of the fleeing wives of post-apocalyptic dictator Immortan Joe in ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015). A more sedate turn as the fiancÃ©e of an incorrigible drinker in ""Ruben Guthrie"" (2015) followed, but she was soon back in spectacle mode with a minor appearance in ""Gods of Egypt"" (2016) and a supporting role as a predatory model in Nicolas Winding-Refn's ""The Neon Demon"" (2016). That same year, Lee was announced as the female lead in the Ron Howard-produced ""Dark Tower,"" based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King."

Though he worked as a mechanic's apprentice until his music career took off, he became increasingly serious about his identity as a performer, officially changing his name at age 26. He would later describe the decision as an expression of his newly formed identity as a musician, a recovering alcoholic, and an openly gay man. In 1999, he released his first album, the rootsy ""The Hip Bone Connection."" Another album, ""Big Grandfather,"" came in 2001, which began to explore a more theatrical sound. iOTA moved his career to the stage in 2005, playing the lead in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" at the Newtown RSL in 2005.

Born and raised in a middle-class family in Sydney, Sampson always had a lingering desire to perform. As a young boy, however, he lacked discipline, and was briefly sent to an Australian boarding school by his parents. The stint at boarding school worked, and Sampson eventually returned to his regular high school. It was there that he joined the school's drama department, and before long was appearing in school productions of plays. Through acting, Sampson found an easy outlet to channel his teenage angst and frustration, and soon enough, decided that he would devote his life to the craft. He started auditioning for mostly TV roles after high school in the mid-'90s, and even landed a few minor guest spots in his native Australia. By the early 2000s Sampson started appearing in small roles in movies, including ""Fat Pizza"" (2003), ""Footy Legends"" (2006), and ""Rats and Cats"" (2007). In 2009 he donned a massive suit as one of the beasts in director Spike Jonze's ""Where The Wild Things Are."" His big break came the following year when he played Tucker in ""Insidious"" (2010). The low-budget horror film was a major success at the box office, and spawned two sequels, both of which Sampson appeared in. Sampson continued to land roles throughout the early 2010s, before going on to have his biggest year in 2015. In addition to appearing in the third installment of the ""Insidious"" franchise, Sampson also nabbed parts in the explosive action reboot ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (2015), and the TV series, ""Fargo"" (FX, 2014- ). On ""Fargo,"" Sampson played the recurring role of Bear Gearhart."

But it was the much better sequel ""The Road Warrior"" (1980) that catapulted both director and star into international fame. From there, he directed Gibson in the studio-made sequel, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" (1985) and helmed the horror comedy ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1987), starring Jack Nicholson as Satan lusting after three lonely women. After producing ""Flirting"" (1991), Nicole Kidman's final Australian production before transitioning to Hollywood, Miller wrote and directed the acclaimed tearjerker ""Lorenzo's Oil"" (1992). He had one of his biggest critical and commercial hits with the endearing ""Babe"" (1995) and it's equally delightful sequel ""Babe: Pig in the City"" (1996), before winning the Oscar for Best Animated Film for his box-office smash ""Happy Feet"" (2006).

The former possessed striking contrasts between the big city of Philadelphia and the fields of the Amish Country, yet each created a full-bodied environment. For the latter, Seale had to accomplish the photography on three levels: the desert in which Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas have their romance, the war-torn zone of Italy, which required darker, bluer lighting, and the re-emergence of life within Juliette Binoche, which had to be gradually worked into the palette.

Age 13 at the time of her casting in the Coen Brothers' 2010 remake, Steinfeld wowed audiences with the strength of her confident performance, which earned numerous critical awards and nominations, as well as predictions of stardom to come. Born Dec. 11, 1996 in Thousand Oaks, CA, Hailee Steinfeld knew that she wanted to be an actress from a very young age. She had fallen in love with the craft after seeing a neighbor perform in a play, and became further enamored after her cousins began making appearances in television commercials. However, Steinfeld's parents insisted that she attend acting classes before they would consider booking her an agent to pursue her career goals. Her family held to their promise, and Steinfeld began landing roles in television commercials and short films. Her all-American looks and natural poise made her a natural for idealized young women, including an angel in the short ""Heather: A Fairy Tale"" (2008) and a dream girl worthy of sacrificing a beloved mullet in ""She's a Fox"" (2009).

After traveling across the Southwest and auditioning some 5,000 actresses, they found Steinfeld in Los Angeles, and cast her within a week of meeting her. Days later, she was on a plane to Texas to begin filming. Reviewers on the whole agreed with the Coens' choice for their young heroine. Steinfeld received rave reviews for her spirited performance, as well as three Best Supporting Actress awards and a score of nominations from state and national film critic associations. In December of 2010, she received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Female Actor in a Supporting Role, and a month later, an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. After some time away from screen work, Steinfeld returned in 2013 with a number of projects. She starred as Juliet opposite fellow actor-on-the-rise Douglas Booth in a feature adaptation of William Shakespeare's perennially performed romantic tragedy ""Romeo & Juliet"" and portrayed the key character of Petra Arkanian in the sci-fi adventure ""Ender's Game,"" based on the Orson Scott Card novel and starring Asa Butterfield and Harrison Ford.

After he auditioned for a production of Come and Gone at Morehouse College and landed the lead part, he quit his business major to focus on acting. Henry ended up graduating from the Yale School of Drama with a Masters in Acting in 2007 and performed in various stage and Off-Broadway productions in the years following. He even portrayed Tybalt in a Shakespeare in the Park production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Oscar Isaac, who played Romeo. In 2009, Henry made his TV debut in an episode of ""Law and Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010), then followed it up with an appearance on ""The Good Wife"" (CBS, 2009-2016) in 2010. He made his Broadway debut as a part of the original ensemble cast of The Book of Mormon in 2011. In 2013, Henry made a two-part appearance as Winston ""Scrapper"" on ""Boardwalk Empire"" (HBO, 2010-2014), and subsequently showed up in an episode of the first season of ""The Knick"" (Cinemax, 2014-15). Henry made his feature film debut in the Luis Guzman-led comedy Puerto Ricans in Paris in 2015.

After making her debut on ""The Garry Moore Show"" (CBS, 1950-1967), Tomlin made a splash on ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In"" (NBC, 1968-1973), particularly as the nasal-voiced telephone operator Ernestine. She went on to become a Grammy-winning recording artist for her comedy album, This Is a Recording (1972), while also starring in and co-writing three primetime television specials, each of which won Emmy Awards. Tomlin made her feature film debut as a troubled gospel singer in Robert Altman's landmark ""Nashville"" (1975) before appearing on Broadway for the first time in her one-woman show, ""Appearing Nightly"" (1977), which she co-wrote with life partner Jane Wagner.  She skyrocketed to superstardom opposite Jane Fonda and Dolly Parton in the hit comedy ""9 to 5"" (1980), while her one-woman show, ""The Search for Intelligent Life in the Universe"" (1986), earned Tomlin a Tony Award. On television, she delivered an acclaimed performance in ""And the Band Played On"" (HBO, 1993), while giving inspired performances in ""Short Cuts"" (1993) and ""Flirting with Disaster"" (1996).  Tomlin remained capable of turning in acclaimed and often unexpected performances more than five decades into her career, and was rewarded with a mid-2010s resurgence that included a critically-acclaimed situation comedy and her first starring role in over a quarter-century in Paul Weitz's ""Grandma"" (2015)."

Born in Chicago to parents who had attended Yale with Bill and Hillary Clinton (the subject of one of his funniest stand-up routines), Mulaney's comedy career started early: he was only seven years old when he first began performing in a children's sketch group called ""The Rugrats."" The affinity for all things show business continued through his formative years, with an evolution into improv and stand-up comedy coming later while attending Georgetown University. His first success came behind the camera, when his film ""Calvalcade of Personalities"" won the Emerging Comics of New York (ECNY) award for best short film in 2006. One year later, he also picked up that same group's award for Best Stand Up. Television writing followed next on his resume including a stint on ""Important Things With Demetri Martin"" (Comedy Central 2009-2010) and frequent appearances as a panelist on the weekly news roundup ""Best Week Ever"" (VH1 2004-09). Mulaney was then encouraged to audition for ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ) by stars Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers, and was hired as a staff writer in 2008. Mulaney's best-known creation during his four-year SNL tenure was Stefon, a contributor to Meyers' Weekend Update feature played by Mulaney's co-writer Bill Hader. An immediate fan favorite, Stefon was an entertainment correspondent whose suggestions for family activities became progressively more surreal and inappropriate. The Stefon sketches were particularly notorious for Hader's frequent on-air crack-ups while performing the character, which were caused by Mulaney adding and changing jokes on the cue cards between dress rehearsal and the live broadcast. Mulaney was frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for Meyers at the Weekend Update desk, but he left the show in 2012 to work on an autobiographical sitcom called ""Mulaney."" Despite being executive produced by Lorne Michaels and co-starring fellow SNL alum Nasim Pedrad, the ""Mulaney"" pilot was not picked up by NBC for the 2013-14 season. The series was picked up by Fox for the 2014 fall season, with Pedrad, Elliott Gould, Martin Short and Zack Pearlman filling out the cast."

Ever since he could remember, Nicolas Cage wanted to be an actor. He was born Nicolas Kim Coppola in Long Beach, California, and from a young age harbored dreams of being up on the 60-foot silver screen, just like his childhood idol James Dean. Of course, it helped that his famous uncle was none other than Francis Ford Coppola, the Academy Award-winning director of such modern classics as ""The Godfather"" (1972) and ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). However, Cage viewed his famous surname as more of a nuisance than anything, which is why he changed it early in his career. Cage attended Beverly Hills High School, and it was there that he first began acting. He studied theater at the school, but long desired to be acting in movies. Feeling like high school was holding him back, Cage dropped out in his senior year to pursue acting full-time. He nabbed his first role when was 18 in the high school drama ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982). Although Cage's role in the film was minor, it gave him the confidence to charge full-steam ahead in building an acting career for himself. By the early 1980s he had changed his surname to Cage, after the Marvel superhero Luke Cage, and with the name change, saw his acting prospects rise. He was cast in his first substantial role as the lead in the 1983 comedy ""Valley Girl,"" and over the next few years started steadily building a name for himself with parts in films like ""Rumble Fish"" (1983), ""The Cotton Club"" (1984), ""Birdy"" (1984), and ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" (1986). Both ""Rumble Fish"" and ""The Cotton Club"" were directed by his Uncle Francis. With his acting career on the upswing, Cage nabbed a breakout role as a manic ex-con in the Coen Brothers' crime comedy ""Raising Arizona."" Although the film drew mixed reviews upon its release, it has since grown in appreciation by critics, with Cage's hilarious performance as H.I. ""Hi"" McDunnough being singled out as one of the film's highlights. After ""Raising Arizona,"" Cage began displaying his versatility as an actor by appearing in a wide array of different film genres. He appeared in romantic comedies like ""Moonstruck"" (1987) and ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" (1992), horror films like ""Vampire's Kiss"" (1988), and crime thrillers like ""Red Rock West"" (1993) and ""Kiss of Death"" (1995). Then in 1995 Cage floored both audiences and critics with his magnetic performance as a suicidal alcoholic in the bleak drama ""Leaving Las Vegas."" For his performance in the film, Cage took home an Oscar for Best Actor-his first. Although he could never quite be pinned down to one specific genre of film, by the late-1990s Cage began starring in a number of big-budget genre pictures made for the masses. These films included ""The Rock"" (1996), ""Con Air"" (1997), ""Face/Off"" (1998), and ""8 MM"" (1999). He did make time to star in Martin Scorsese's dark drama ""Bringing out the Dead"" in 1999, and earned his second Oscar nod for his role as screenwriter Charlie Kaufman in 2002's ""Adaptation,"" but by the mid-2000s Cage's acting output was relegated almost exclusively to effect-heavy films with huge budgets. These included ""National Treasure,"" ""Knowing"" (2009), ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (2010), ""Kick-Ass"" (2010) and ""Drive Angry"" (2011). Cage would still, on occasion, make time to appear in more character driven works, among them ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans"" (2009), ""Joe"" (2013), and ""Snowden"" (2016). But for the most part, by the 2010s he was mostly appearing in genre films. The 2010s also saw Cage's output increase at a furious rate, with the actor appearing in multiple films a year. In 2019 alone he appeared in six films, among them ""Primal,"" about a rare captive jaguar that escapes, and ""Running with the Devil,"" a crime thriller which co-starred Laurence Fishburne. By 2020, Nicolas Cage had been acting professionally for nearly 40 years and had appeared in over 100 films (according to IMDB), thus making him one of the most prolific film actors of his generation."

An NBC executive spotted the Cleveland-raised Hahn doing regional theater and vaulted her in due course to the role of big-hearted Lily Lebowski on ""Jordan,"" whom she would play over six seasons and some soapy story arcs. Meanwhile, she found a character niche in feature films, playing devoted BFFs to female leads in by-the-numbers romantic comedies like ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" (2003) and ""A Lot Like Love"" (2005), as well as gave aggressively ribald turns in ""Step Brothers"" (2008) and ""The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard"" (2009). She became a frequent support player to Paul Rudd, with the pair co-starring in four films, including ""Our Idiot Brother"" (2011) and ""Wanderlust"" (2012). Hahn took her talents to Broadway in 2008 in the hit revival of the French farce ""Boeing-Boeing."" She undertook some big-ticket comedy projects in the 2011-12 television season, landing the lead in NBC's ill-fated ""Free Agents"" (2011) and, upon its cancellation, reuniting with Rudd again as his delightfully mercenary campaign advisor on the network's ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC, 2009-15). Wielding a seemingly innate capacity to steal scenes from bigger stars, Hahn made herself a versatile talent producers pine for, while perhaps logging more screen-time as a pregnant woman than any other actor."

He came to prominence in the late 1990s after a long string of performances in indie features, and gained widespread notice as town loner and red herring Cotton Weary in Wes Craven's ""Scream"" (1996) and its two sequels. The exposure helped usher him into more mainstream projects, such the HBO TV movie ""RKO 281"" (1999), for which he played Orson Welles; the Tom Clancy adventure ""The Sum of All Fears"" (2002); and  the cable series ""Ray Donovan"" (Showtime 2013- ). Off camera, Schreiber was a Tony Award winner and veteran of numerous New York stage productions, making his directorial debut with an adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer's ""Everything is Illuminated"" (2005), proving that he possessed talents far beyond simply acting."

From the moment he made his professional debut on an episode of ""ER"" (NBC, 1994-2010), Pine was on the fast track to celebrity, logging other guest spots on the likes of ""The Guardian"" (CBS, 2001-04) and ""CSI: Miami"" (CBS, 2002-12) before landing a high-profile co-starring role opposite Anne Hathaway in ""The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement"" (2004). He next starred alongside tabloid fodder Lindsay Lohan in the romantic comedy ""Just My Luck"" (2006), while earning a bit of street cred as a psychotic neo-Nazi in the crime thriller ""Smokin Aces"" (2007). But Pine hit the big time when he signed on to play Captain James T. Kirk in J.J. Abrams' retooling of ""Star Trek"" (2009). The hugely successful film and the sci-fi lore associated with it elevated him to another level in his career, making Pine one of the most-watched young actors in Hollywood virtually overnight. That visibility led not only to the continuation of the series in ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013) and ""Star Trek Beyond"" (2016), but other high-profile films ranging from Stephen Sondheim adaptation ""Into the Woods"" (2014) to comic book blockbuster ""Wonder Woman"" (2017).

But beneath her toned veneer was a bubbling comedic energy and a self-effacing smirk that brought a spark to her performances. Best known for her all-too short role as Wendy Watson on the comic series ""The Middleman"" (ABC Family 2008), she continued to charm audiences and critics alike whether she was an FBI agent on ""White Collar"" (USA 2009-14), Aziz Ansari's formidable girlfriend on ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC 2009-) or the spunky sidekick on the critically-acclaimed sitcom ""Trophy Wife"" (ABC 2013-14). Natalie Morales was born February 15, 1985 in the Miami suburb of Kendall, Florida. Raised in a Cuban family, she attended private school until 8th grade before applying to a magnet school to study law. But due to a serendipitous mix-up, she ended up attending public high school instead and enrolled in drama school freshman year since it was the only elective available. This seemingly trivial chain of events is what set her career path in motion. After graduating high school, she moved out to Los Angeles in 2005, with two of her closest friends from drama class. Morales developed her knack for physical comedy doing theater and sketch comedy before her big break happened when she met her manager the following year. Soon after, she burst onto the scene with her scene-stealing role as the female lead in the superhero dramedy ""The Middleman"" in 2008. While the sci-fi show didn't last beyond its initial 13-episode order, it lived on in the hearts of fans. After ""The Middleman"" fizzled out, Morales took on a guest-starring role on the snappy, comedic procedural series ""White Collar"" (USA 2009-14). Her take-no-prisoners character, special agent Lauren Cruz, was a hit with fans, and she was soon promoted to series regular. But when the second season rolled around, there was a case of musical chairs with casting and an actress who was returning to the series replaced her. Despite this minor setback, Morales quickly found work and returned to her comedic roots, joining the hit series ""Parks and Recreation"" for a brief arc as the new girlfriend of the recently-divorced Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) in 2010. That year brought continued success not only on the small screen but also marked Morales' big screen debut. She flexed her acting muscles by playing a ruthless Wall Street trader in Oliver Stone's sequel ""Wall Street 2"" (2010), as well as Drew Barrymore's best gal pal in the romantic comedy ""Going the Distance"" (2010). After wrapping the indie comedy ""6 Month Rule"" (2011) in New York, she returned to Los Angles and the world of television, taking a short but memorable guest spot on Aaron Sorkin's ""The Newsroom"" (HBO 2012-14), where her character got Jeff Daniels' news anchor high before a broadcast. Leaving behind the highbrow world of Sorkin's banter-heavy series, Morales landed a recurring spot on the fifth season of teen-soap reboot ""90210"" (CW 2008-), followed shortly after by her supporting role on the dysfunctional family comedy ""Trophy Wife."" Despite its unfortunate title, the series starring Malin Ackerman as Bradley Whitford's reformed party-girl wife was a sleeper hit for the network, and allowed Morales free range to fit her character's wild spirit - even if that meant going topless on television. Despite initially shaky ratings, ""Trophy Wife"" was extended for a full season and Morales was announced as a guest star in season three of ""Girls"" (HBO 2012-17). After co-starring on the Rob Lowe legal comedy ""The Grinder"" (Fox 2015-16), Morales appeared in arcs on Drew Barrymore's horror comedy ""Santa Clarita Diet"" (Netflix 2017- ) and superhero comedy ""Powerless"" (NBC 2017) and guest starred on the comedy series ""Grace and Frankie"" (Netflix 2015- ), ""Crashing"" (HBO 2017- ) and ""Imaginary Mary"" (ABC 2017)."

Persichetti began working in animation in 1997, acting as an inbetweener on ""Hercules"" (1997). He would continue to work at Disney for the next five years, assisting animators on such projects as ""Mulan"" (1998), ""Tarzan"" (1999), ""Fantastia 2000"" (1999), ""The Emperor's New Groove"" (2000), ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" (2001), and ""Treasure Planet"" (2002). During this time, with CGI animation on the rise, Disney's continued use of 2D cell animation was causing them to fall behind, and Persichetti soon decamped for the greener pastures of Dreamworks Animation, where he worked as a storyboard artist on ""Shrek 2"" (2004), ""Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" (2005), ""Flushed Away"" (2006), ""Shrek the Halls"" (2007), and ""Monsters and Aliens"" (2009). He was promoted to Head of Story for his next project, ""Puss in Boots"" (2015), a title he also held for Netflix's animated adaptation of ""The Little Prince"" (2015), which he co-wrote with screenwriter Irena Brignull. Persichetti got his big break when he was tapped alongside Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman to co-direct the first animated film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018). The film's psychedelic visuals, a combination of computer animation and hand-drawn comic book techniques, its inspirational good humor, and stellar voice cast (including Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, John Mulaney, and Nicolas Cage) wowed both critics and audiences, and the film won Best Animated Feature film at the 46th Annie Awards, the 76th Golden Globe Awards, the 24th Critics' Choice Awards, and the 72nd BAFTA Film Awards, plus a nomination in that category at the 91st Academy Awards."

He also worked as a second unit director for John Singleton on ""Poetic Justice"" (1993) and ""Higher Learning"" (1995). He began working in animation as a storyboard artist for the Will Smith vehicle ""Shark Tale"" (2004). The relationship with that film's studio, DreamWorks, proved fruitful when he was selected to direct the television special ""Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins From Outer Space"" (NBC, 2009). He stepped up to directing features with ""Rise of the Guardians"" (2012) about mythological characters banding together to stop an evil force. The film earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Animated Feature Film. He continued lending his artistic talents to other films while also developing what would become his breakout project. Along with Rodney Rothman and Bob Persichetti, he took the reigns of an animated feature built around Marvel's Spider-Man. Instead of focusing strictly on original alter-ego Peter Parker, the story looked at a group of other characters from the comics who had worn the web-slinging costume.

He attended Middlebury College then landed a job as a junior writer on ""Late Show with David Letterman"" (CBS, 1993-2015) that lasted for five years and ended with Rothman as head writer and producer. Once he left the show, Rothman wrote an article for The New Yorker, which became controversial when it was revealed that he had fictionalized some of his story. The scandal didn't prevent him from landing a job as a writer on ""Undeclared"" (Fox, 2001-02) a comedy created by Judd Apatow and Paul Feig. The show never found an audience and was cancelled, which left Rothman bereft. He decided to retire at age 28. Or, at least, he decided to move to a retirement community and live there for a few months. He turned that experience into a Early Bird, a non-fiction book which caught the eye of executives at NBC, who went far enough to make a pilot for the show before deciding not to go forward. Retirement over, Rothman landed work as a writer on the comedy series ""Committed"" (NBC, 2005) then on the show ""Help Me Help You"" (ABC, 2006) starring Ted Danson. He made his feature film debut, contributing to the screenplay for ""Grudge Match"" (2013) starring Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro as retired rivals who are enticed to get back into the ring for one last fight.

This string of successes made them among the most commercially viable filmmakers of the early 2010s. Lord was born on July 12, 1975 in Miami, Florida. A 1997 graduate of Dartmouth College, Lord met Miller while the two were in college. Lord and Miller first broke into the entertainment industry when they landed a pair of recurring roles in the Lea Thompson sitcom ""Caroline in the City"" (NBC 1995-99). Meanwhile, Lord and Miller began their careers as writers on ""Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane"" (The WB, 1999-2000), a short-lived sitcom that starred Selma Blair and Michael Rosenbaum. Although Lord and Miller's early days were filled with short-lived roles and plenty of failures -- including a failed drawing test for the ""The Rugrats Movie"" -- the duo continued to work on their ideas, including an animated series about a high school populated by clones of famous historical figures that they pitched to several networks. Their first break occurred when Lord and Miller convinced MTV to turn their idea into a series. ""Clone High"" (MTV 2002-03) was the result, with Lord and Miller working on multiple fronts as writer, producer, director and voice actor on the animated series. Although ""Clone High"" only lasted one season, it proved to be a turning point in their careers. Although their next project, the culture-clash sitcom ""Luis"" (Fox 2003) was almost immediately cancelled after its debut, they jumped aboard a new sitcom called ""How I Met Your Mother"" (CBS 2005-2014). The show became a hit, with Lord and Miller credited as the writers of the episodes ""Belly Full of Turkey"" and ""The Sweet Taste of Liberty"" and co-executive producers on 17 episodes of the show's first season. Lord and Miller pounced on the opportunities that quickly sprouted. They made their feature film directorial debut with ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" (2009), a computer animated science fiction comedy based on a children's book about a scientist's weather machine gone horribly awry. Starring the voices of Bill Hader and Anna Faris, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" was a critical and commercial success. It was nominated for a couple of Annie Awards and a Best Animated feature nod at the 67th Golden Globe Awards. The duo followed ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" with ""21 Jump Street"" (2011), a feature film reboot of an old 1980s television series that starred Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, ""21 Jump Street"" was a surprise success. The duo returned to direct ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" (2013) and served as executive producers on former ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ) cast member Andy Samberg's police sitcom ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" (Fox 2013-). Lord and Miller had their next blockbuster success with ""The Lego Movie"" (2013), an animated feature with an all-star cast that included Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell and Elizabeth Banks. (The pair served as producers for the film's sequels, including ""The Lego Batman Movie"" (2017) and ""The Lego Ninjago Movie"" (2017), but didn't write or direct them.) After directing the sequel ""22 Jump Street"" (2014), Lord and Miller returned to TV as executive producers of ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Fox 2015- ), a quirky sitcom starring Will Forte and Kristen Schaal as the heads of a band of survivors of an unnamed apocalypse. The part-animated dysfunctional-family sitcom ""Son of Zorn"" (Fox 2016-17) and time travel comedy ""Making History"" (Fox 2017) followed, but both were canceled after a single season. In 2016, Lord and Miller were named as directors of a 2018 standalone film in the Star Wars Universe starring Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo.

Bendis brought a variety of characters to life on the page of indie and mainstream comics-notably in publications like Jinx, Torso, and Ultimate Spider-Man-as well as on the screen, writing and producing a number of Spider-Man and Spider-Woman animated series. With the translation of his original creations Powers and the Jessica Jones character to screen in the series ""A.K.A.

Starting off as a toy designer, his successful track record - a line of X-Men action figures were massive bestsellers - allowed Arad to branch out into television animation, producing cartoon series such as ""Spider-Man"" (Fox, 1994-98). He put himself on the map as executive producer on successful feature film adaptations of ""Blade"" (1998), ""X-Men"" (2000), ""Spider-Man"" (2002) and ""The Hulk"" (2003). Aside from his filmmaking duties, the multi-talented Arad also oversaw the merchandising lines from these movies, in addition to those from the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. While some efforts like ""Elektra"" (2005) proved less satisfactory, hits on the order of ""Iron Man"" (2008), bore out Arad's assertion that, if done right, comic book heroes provided nearly limitless franchise - and merchandizing - opportunities. It was Arad's passion and vision that not only placed him at the table of Hollywood's elite filmmakers, but also helped transform a company once perilously close to bankruptcy into an entertainment juggernaut at the forefront of pop culture evolution."

Known to be popular with screenwriters and passionate in her advocacy for films, she followed the classic Hollywood rise first trademarked by Irving Thalberg more than 70 years ago - going from secretary to head of production at a studio. Moving up the ladder to chair of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Pascal was among the ranks of just a handful of women who had raised the bar for females in positions of power in Hollywood. She did so by overseeing such feature film hits as ""Hitch,"" (2004) ""The Da Vinci Code,"" (2006) and the mammoth success of the ""Spider-Man"" multi-million dollar franchise - in the process, becoming one of the most respected studio heads, male or female, in the business."

Often partnered with friend and colleague Phil Lord, the pair were best known as the creative force behind films such as the ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" movies, ""21 Jump Street"" (2012), and ""The Lego Movie"" (2013). The commercial success of these films was enormous, and they were generally liked by critics as well, yet the pair managed to stay out of the Hollywood limelight even as they became successful. Miller was born on September 23, 1975 in Everett, Washington. He attended Dartmouth College, where he met Phil Lord and graduated in 1997. After graduation, Miller and Lord broke into the entertainment industry by nabbing roles in the Lea Thompson sitcom ""Caroline in the City"" (NBC 1995-99), where Miller played a recurring role as Cliff over a span of three episodes. Meanwhile, Miller and Lord jumped aboard the writing staff of ""Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane"" (The WB, 1999-2000), a short-lived ""Friends"" (NBC 1994-2004) copycat that starred Selma Blair and Michael Rosenbaum. The pair's humble beginnings continued when they tried to work on ""The Rugrats Movie"" (1998) as animators but failed the initial drawing test. Undaunted, Miller and Lord continued to work on their ideas for an animated series. After pitching their ideas to several networks, Miller and Lord convinced MTV to pick up ""Clone High"" (2002-03), an adult animated television series about a high school populated by clones of famous historical figures. Miller and Lord worked on multiple fronts as writers, producers, directors and voice actors on the animated series. Although ""Clone High"" only lasted one season, they gained valuable connections an experience in such a truncated amount of time. They immediately jumped aboard on a couple of new shows, ""Luis"" (Fox 2003) and ""How I Met Your Mother"" (CBS 2005-2014). Although Fox quickly cancelled production soon after ""Luis"" premiered, ""How I Met Your Mother"" was a veritable smash hit. Miller and Lord served as co-executive producers on the show's first season, with Miller credited as a writer for the episodes ""Belly Full of Turkey"" and ""The Sweet Taste of Liberty."" Miller and Lord's newfound success led to more opportunities. Trying their hand at animation once again, the two partners wrote and produced ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" (2009), a computer animated science fiction comedy based on a children's book about a scientist's weather machine gone horribly awry. Starring the voices of Bill Hader and Anna Faris, ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" was a critical and commercial success, nominated for a couple of Annie Awards and a Best Animated Feature nod at the 67th Golden Globe Awards. Their next directorial effort was ""21 Jump Street,"" a comedic feature film reboot an old 1980s television police drama starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Although there were many doubters, ""21 Jump Street"" was a surprise success. Over the next couple of years, Miller and Lord continued to put out quality movies and shows that resonated with audiences. In 2013, the duo was tapped again to direct ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2"" and later that year, they served as executive producers of ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" (Fox 2013-), a sitcom starring former ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ) alum Andy Samberg. While movies released in the first quarter of the year tend not to draw big crowds, Miller and Lord bucked the trend with ""The Lego Movie"" (2014). An animated feature that centered around the classic children's building blocks, ""The Lego Movie"" wowed audiences both young and old, with a voice cast that featured Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell and Elizabeth Banks. The movie was praised for its unique animation and creative storyline and became the biggest movie released in February of 2014. (The pair served as producers for the film's sequels, including ""The Lego Batman Movie"" (2017) and ""The Lego Ninjago Movie"" (2017), but didn't write or direct them.) After directing the sequel ""22 Jump Street"" (2014), Lord and Miller returned to TV as executive producers of ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Fox 2015- ), a quirky sitcom starring Will Forte and Kristen Schaal as the heads of a band of survivors of an unnamed apocalypse. The part-animated dysfunctional-family sitcom ""Son of Zorn"" (Fox 2016-17) and time travel comedy ""Making History"" (Fox 2017) followed, but both were canceled after a single season.

Moonlight, which follows a boy's life in a bad Miami neighborhood, was made up of three acts, each portraying different phases of Chiron's life; Hibbert starred in the first act, as his character Chiron is befriended by a drug dealer and deals with a mother addicted to cocaine. Hibbert grew up in an area of Miami similar to the one portrayed in the movie, which potentially led to the inspiration for his portrayal."

Like Chiron, he was bullied by peers throughout elementary and middle school, and was raised by other individuals while his parents grappled with substance abuse issues. He found solace in performance at the Amazing Grace Conservatory, an arts program based in South Central Los Angeles, which convinced him to pursue acting as a career. Sanders made his screen debut at the age of 15 in ""The Retrieval"" (2013), an independent historical drama about a young African-American boy in the Civil War South who is sent to help capture a former slave that he befriended. He then logged a minor role in ""Straight Outta Compton"" before enrolling in DePaul University's esteemed theater program. While there, he received the script for ""Moonlight,"" and was cast as the teenaged Chiron, who endures physical and emotional abuse from all corners of his life, including his mother (Naomie Harris) and the object of his affection (Jharrel Jerome). Sanders' performance was praised by critics, and earned numerous accolades, including two individual acting nominations from the Black Reel Awards and ensemble laurels from the Independent Spirit and Gotham Awards."

After graduating from UT, Rhodes started to work as an actor, making his film debut in a short film called ""I Came Back"" (2012). His next role, an uncredited passing appearance in the Elijah Wood-led horror film ""Open Windows"" (2014), preceded his television debut in an unnamed appearance on the short-lived drama ""Gang Related"" (Fox, 2014).

He starred as the adult Chiron in the epic life-spanning story of heartbreak and romance, ""Moonlight"" (2016); Rhodes was praised for his performance, with many critics naming it his breakout appearance.

She based her music around a science fiction concept of a dystopian world called ""Metropolis,"" and developed the alter ego of an android, Cindi Mayweather, living in the year 2719. For all the visionary trappings of her music, MonÃ¡e was also a straightforward pop singer who fully engaged with the 21st-century pop mainstream, starring in makeup commercials for a major international brand and finding success in the animated cartoon feature ""Rio 2"" (2014) and period drama ""Hidden Figures"" (2016). Janelle MonÃ¡e Robinson was born on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. As a child, MonÃ¡e often lived in her own imaginary world, which would later inspire her music. MonÃ¡e moved to New York to study drama at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, and also went to a performing arts school called Freedom Theatre in Philadelphia. MonÃ¡e moved to Atlanta in 2001, where she met her early mentor, rapper and producer Big Boi from OutKast. Founding her own arts collective and record label, Wondaland Arts Society, MonÃ¡e self-released her first EP, The Audition. Although The Audition didn't get much exposure, it did bring MonÃ¡e to the attention of Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who signed her to his Bad Boy label in 2006. There, MonÃ¡e began plotting out an ambitious series of concept recordings collectively known as ""Metropolis,"" the story of a runaway android named Cindi Mayweather in the year 2719. First came the EP Metropolis: Suite 1 (The Chase), a critically-acclaimed released that earned MonÃ¡e an opening slot for No Doubt in 2009. MonÃ¡e kept forging ahead with the Metropolis concept, releasing her full-length debut The ArchAndroid in 2010. Featuring the hit singles ""Tightrope"" and ""Cold War,"" the acclaimed album was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. MonÃ¡e also won the ASCAP Vanguard Award at the Billboard Music Awards in 2010. In keeping the multimedia reality of modern pop stardom, MonÃ¡e then became a spokeswoman for an extensive TV and print ad campaign for CoverGirl, and also appeared in commercials for Sonos Wireless HiFi. MonÃ¡e became a bona fide pop star when her guest performance on the song ""We Are Young"" by the New York alt-rock act Fun. became a number-one hit in 2012. MonÃ¡e's second solo album, The Electric Lady, came out in September 2013, continuing the Metropolis storyline and featuring the hit single ""Q.U.E.E.N.,"" with a guest spot by Queen Latifah. She then performed at a ""Women of Soul"" concert at the White House along with legends Patti LaBelle, Aretha Franklin, and more. In addition to her successful music career, MonÃ¡e provided the voice of Dr. MonÃ¡e in the animated hit ""Rio 2"" (2014), and also wrote and performed a song for the soundtrack, ""What Is Love."" Monae's acting career took a major stride forward with her starring role alongside Octavia Spencer in the '60s-set NASA-based drama ""Hidden Figures"" (2016). Following a five-year break from music, which she attributed partly to the death of her idol and latter-day mentor Prince, MonÃ¡e returned with the album Dirty Computer in April 2018. While doing press for the album, MonÃ¡e addressed her sexuality for the first time, declaring herself ""pansexual"" in an interview with Rolling Stone."

Both characters are struggling with sexual identity, and in a pivotal scene they share a sexual encounter. Jerome was born in October 1997 and grew up in the Bronx.

Born December 28, 1979 in Bessemer, Alabama, he was the son of a salesman and a steel plant employee, and would have gone into law had he not taken a role in a Birmingham production of ""Oliver!"" at the age of 11. Holland studied drama at John Carroll High School and later, at Florida State University and New York University, from which he received a master's degree in fine arts in 2006. That same year, he began working on television and stage, scoring critical praise for playing three characters in the play ""Blue Door"" and making his television debut in an episode of ""Law and Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010). Featured turns in Spike Lee's ""Miracle at St. Anna"" (2008) and other features soon followed, as did ""The Brother/Sister Plays"" (2009), a trilogy of dramas that began Holland's working relationship with playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney. Acclaim for his stage work led to more substantive roles on television, including that of White House Press Secretary Marshall Malloy, who was carrying on an affair with the President's daughter (Martha MacIsaac), in the short-lived sitcom ""1600 Penn"" (NBC, 2012-13), and Dr. Algernon C. Edwards, a 19th-century surgeon who endured racial prejudice, on ""The Knick"" (Cinemax, 2014-15). The exposure afforded from these roles led to major supporting turns in features like ""42"" (2013), as African-American sportswriter Wendell Smith, and ""Selma"" (2014), for which he received an NAACP Image Award nomination for playing civil rights activist Andrew Young. In 2016, he appeared in ""Moonlight"" (2016), director Barry Jenkins' film version of McCraney's autobiographical play ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue."" The drama, which cast Holland as the adult Kevin, first love to the film's troubled protagonist, Chiron/Little, earned exceptional reviews from critics and award shows alike. Holland compounded the success with a supporting role in ""American Horror Story: Roanoke"" (FX, 2016) and by joining the cast of Ava DuVernay's highly anticipated film adaptation of ""A Wrinkle in Time"" (2018)."

Born November 19, 1979 in Miami, Florida, he was raised, along with his three brothers, in the Liberty Square neighborhood of Liberty City. His childhood was marked by turmoil: his father died shortly before separating from his mother and declaring that Jenkins was not his biological son, while his mother struggled with drug addiction and left him to be raised by another woman. Jenkins survived his tumultuous upbringing, and excelled at football at Miami Northwestern Senior High School. From there, he attended Florida State University, where on a whim, he signed up for the school's film program. There, he met and befriended fellow students Adele Romanski and James Laxton, who would later serve as producer and cinematographer, respectively, on ""Moonlight."" After directing several short films at Florida State, Jenkins directed his first feature, the independent romantic drama ""Medicine for Melancholy"" (2008). The film received excellent reviews and numerous nominations from national film festivals and awards, but was followed by a five-year period in which he developed several feature projects that never came to fruition. To support himself, Jenkins co-founded an advertising and content studio and wrote for drama series ""The Leftovers"" (HBO 2015- ). He eventually found his next project with ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,"" a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney, a fellow Liberty City resident who had attended elementary and middle school with Jenkins, though the pair never knew each other. In 2013, he began production on a film version, ""Moonlight,"" a multi-part drama that follows a young African-American boy through three phases of his life, during which he explores issues of family, addiction and sexuality. The drama was among the most critically praised releases of 2016, netting numerous award nominations, including Golden Globe nods for Best Drama and Director.

As he came of age, he attended the University of Missouri, but just shy of graduation, he left, setting sail for California so he could try his hand at becoming an actor in the mid-1980s. His early work was mostly uncredited, with appearances in ""Less Than Zero"" (1987) and an episode of ""21 Jump Street"" (Fox 1987-1991). His first leading film role was in ""The Dark Side of the Sun"" (1988), but the film was barely seen. That was followed up by a starring role on the show ""Glory Days"" (Fox 1990), but that only lasted six episodes. Pitt's first notable role arrived in Ridley Scott's ""Thelma & Louise"" (1991), which led to another scene-stealing turn a few years later in the Quentin Tarantino-written ""True Romance"" (1993). Nearly a decade after leaving college to go to California, Pitt broke through in 1994, where he starred in ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1994) and ""Legends of the Fall"" (1994). He followed that up in the next few years with memorable performances in David Fincher's ""Seven"" (1995) and Terry Gilliam's ""12 Monkeys"" (1995), the latter of which led to his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. That good run of acclaim hit a speed bump after Pitt starred in a pair of commercial and critical disappointments in ""Seven Years in Tibet"" (1997) and ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998). He wasn't down for long, though, as he reunited with David Fincher for his critically acclaimed turn as Tyler Durden in ""Fight Club"" (1999). Around that time is when Pitt met Jennifer Aniston. The two married in 2000 and Pitt even earned an Emmy nomination for a guest role alongside Aniston on ""Friends"" (NBC 1994-2004).

He starred opposite Angelina Jolie in ""Mr & Mrs. Smith"" and that's where their relationship blossomed following Pitt's divorce with Aniston. The pair did not marry until 2014, though they were together in 2005 as Pitt adopted Jolie's children and the two started having their own kids. In 2007, Pitt began a run of acting roles that led to more Oscar buzz and acclaim, starting with ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007) and and leading to his Best Actor-nominated performance in Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008). A few years later, Pitt notched another Best Actor nomination for his performance as Billy Beane in the baseball-inspired ""Moneyball"" (2011). He even earned a credit for the Best Picture nomination ""Moneyball"" received as he was a producer on the movie. Two years later, Pitt would win a Best Picture award for producing ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). While winning awards for behind the scenes work, he still kept up as a box office star with ""World War Z"" (2013). In 2016, Pitt and Jolie separated, coinciding with a stretch where Pitt appeared in more cameos than starring roles. 2019 was a big return, though, as Pitt starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" (2019) and the space drama ""Ad Astra"" (2019)."

Born on October 17, 1980, in Miami, FL, McCraney grew up in Miami's rough and tumble Liberty City projects. Growing up gay, and with a single mother addicted to crack cocaine, McCraney sought solace in the arts. He attended Miami's New World School of the Arts as a teen, and was awarded both the Exemplary Artist award and the Dean's Award in Theater. McCraney continued to study acting at the Theatre School at DePaul University, where he received a BFA in acting. At Yale University, McCraney got a degree in playwriting, graduating in 2007. He was very active as an actor in Chicago's theatre scene, performing at the Steppenwolf theater and the Northlight theater. McCraney's most acclaimed work as a playwright, the ""Brother/Sister"" trilogy of plays, were performed all over the world, most notably at the Young Vic theatre in London. In 2013, McCraney was awarded the MacArthur Genius grant. Around this time, he was introduced through mutual friends to the filmmaker Barry Jenkins, who had also grown up in Liberty City with a single mother who was addicted to drugs. Jenkins was looking for material for a film, and McCraney gave him an unproduced, loosely autobiographical play he wrote as part of his admission packet for Yale, entitled ""In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue."" The film, eventually retitled ""Moonlight,"" was released in late 2016 to nearly universal critical acclaim, ranked number one on many best films of the year list, and was nominated for eight Academy Awards. McCraney and Jenkins won Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay, and in a stunning upset, ""Moonlight"" won Best Picture over the heavily favored ""La La Land"" (but not before presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway infamously opened the wrong envelope live on TV and falsely declared the latter film to be the winner; the stunning error was quickly corrected). McCraney capped off his incredible year by being named the chair of playwriting at his alma matter, Yale School of Drama, a position he will hold as of July 1, 2017."

Although Plan B Entertainment was originally founded by Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, and Brad Grey in 2002, Gardner was brought in when the founding trio split ways in 2006. Her first film under Plan B Entertainment was adapting Augusten Burroughs' memoir ""Running with Scissors"" into a film. Although it featured an impressive cast that included Annette Bening, Alec Baldwin and Gwyneth Paltrow, ""Running with Scissors"" (2006) was poorly received by critics. However, Gardner followed it up with a string of critically-acclaimed films that established Plan B Entertainment a top quality production company. She was nominated for Best Feature at the Independent Spirit Awards for the war drama ""A Mighty Heart"" (2007) and in the following year she received her first Academy Award Best Picture nomination for Terence Malick's experimental drama ""Tree of Life"" (2008), which also starred Brad Pitt. Gardner continued to work with Pitt in her next three productions, all film adaptations of previous literary work. They filmed the neo-noir crime film ""Killing Them Softly"" (2012), followed by the summer blockbuster ""World War Z"" (2013), the zombie-infested horror flick based on the graphic novel of the same name. Later that year, Gardner and Pitt brought the historical drama ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013) to the big screen to near universal acclaim. Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor as an free African-American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, ""12 Years a Slave"" received numerous awards, including Gardner's first Oscar for Best Picture. Gardner followed that triumph with Ava DuVernay's civil rights drama ""Selma"" (2014), Adam McKay's comedy-drama about the 2008 financial meltdown ""The Big Short"" (2015) and supernatural TV drama ""The OA (Netflix 2016).

This scion of a wealthy family in the chemical business first registered in films as a clean-cut, affably handsome lead in the 1940s and he matured into more rough and tumble roles. Along the way his earnest qualities yielded to cynicism, perhaps most notably for writer-director Billy Wilder in ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950) and in his Oscar-winning performance in ""Stalag 17"" (1953). Over the years, the rigors of life and drink re-sculpted his features into an expressive leather that gave testimony to the ravages of the moral ambiguity that had characterized many of his best roles. This quality may have been most eloquently expressed by his central performance as the desperado cowboy Pike in Sam Peckinpah's violent autumnal Western classic, ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969)."

But unlike her silent film contemporaries, Swanson had a trick or two up her sleeve and delivered a powerful, Oscar-nominated performance as the delusional Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950), widely considered to be the greatest film noir ever made. Prior to that triumph, Swanson had reigned supreme during the silent era as a top actress whose elaborate feathered boas and bejeweled headdresses were the height of fashion. She first achieved stardom in several of Cecil B. DeMille's bedroom farces like ""Don't Change Your Husband"" (1919) and ""Why Change Your Wife?"" (1920) before making a series of dramas that propelled her to the top. Mid-decade, Swanson became one of the most famous stars in the world thanks to roles in ""Zaza"" (1923), ""Madame Sans-Gene"" (1925) and ""The Untamed Lady"" (1926).  Prompted to break out and produce her movies independently, Swanson staggered a bit with the production-plagued ""The Love of Sunya"" (1927), but rebounded with ""Sadie Thompson"" (1928) - her last critical and financial hit until ""Sunset Boulevard.""

Arriving in Hollywood in 1914, von Stroheim gained entry into the film industry as a technical advisor and horseman. Later an assistant for D. W. Griffith, von Stroheim brokered a deal, agreeing to work for free for the chance to direct his first film. ""Blind Husbands"" (1919) was a hit despite von Stroheim's insistence on expensive location photography. His budgets would ultimately cost him control of his films, with his nine-hour ""Greed"" (1924) reduced to two and ""The Wedding March"" (1928) shut down after nine months. Fired by star Gloria Swanson during the shooting of ""Queen Kelly"" (1929), von Stroheim was considered unemployable as a director and returned to the life of a jobbing actor. Using his sinister mien to good effect in such quickies as ""The Crime of Dr. Crespi"" (1935) and ""The Great Flamarion"" (1945), von Stroheim contributed vivid supporting performances to Billy Wilder's ""Five Graves to Cairo"" (1943) and ""Sunset Blvd."" (1950), the latter reuniting him with Swanson for an acidic meditation of the dark side of the silver screen.

Olson received an Academy Award nomination for her engaging performance in the film and landed several other starring roles opposite Holden because of it. Olson's career temporarily stalled in the late 1950s, but she reemerged the following decade with plum roles in Disney family films such as ""The Absent-Minded Professor"" (1961) and ""Son of Flubber"" (1963), opposite the likeable Fred MacMurray.

As her workload inclined more towards Poverty Row than the big studios, Hopper gambled on a career change from actress to gossip columnist for the Esquire Feature Syndicate. Her insider knowledge and roster of highly-placed confidantes paid off in an instantly-popular platform, published by The Los Angeles Times in 1938 and syndicated nationally. An interest in the private lives of public figures won Hopper the enmity of such secretive stars as Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, Joseph Cotten, and Katharine Hepburn, while most of Tinseltown endeavored to keep on her good side in a bid to stay out of print. By widening her range to radio and television, Hopper cornered the gossip market and eclipsed the celebrity status of longtime rival Louella Parsons. During the anti-Communist purges of the Fifties, she advocated traditional American values, aligning herself with such staunch Hollywood conservatives as Ronald Reagan and Howard Hughes and counting as allies red-baiting Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Hopper's death in 1966 paralleled the demise of the studio system, while her devotion to laying bare the intimate secrets of Hollywood stars presaged the rise of such culturally entrenched scandal sheets as The National Enquirer and TMZ."

Born in Piqua, KS in 1895, Buster Keaton joined his vaudeville entertainer parents on stage aged just three and continued to perform throughout his childhood before serving in the U.S. Army during the First World War. On his return he forged a working relationship with Fatty Arbuckle, making his acting debut in the comedian's silent two-reel ""The Butcher's Boy"" (2017), and co-starring with him in over a dozen shorts. After appearing in his first full-length feature, ""The Saphead"" (1920), Keaton launched his own eponymous production company, with whom he wrote, directed and starred in two-reels such as ""One Week"" (1920), ""The Playhouse"" (1921) and ""The Electric Wheel"" (1922) and cemented a reputation as a master of the parody. Keaton then moved permanently into feature films where he insisted on performing his own stunts, most memorably breaking his neck without realizing in ""Sherlock Jr."" (1924), hanging onto the front of a locomotive in what many consider to be his masterpiece, ""The General"" (1926), and narrowly avoiding being toppled by a falling house wall in ""Steamboat Bill, Jr."" (1928). However, despite their later status as classics, many of Keaton's labors of love struggled to enamor box office audiences at the time. As a result, Keaton was forced to relinquish his full creative control and he spent several demoralizing years starring in various pictures for MGM, who not only banned him from any stuntwork but also made him film each scene three times in order to capture the international markets. After taking a break from Hollywood to shoot films in England and France, Keaton made several two-reels for Educational Pictures and Columbia, served as a gag writer for the Marx Brothers, Red Skelton and Lucille Ball, and made cameos in ""In the Good Old Summertime"" (1949), ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950) and ""Around the World in 80 Days"" (1956). He also appeared alongside contemporary Charlie Chaplin for the first and only time in ""Limelight"" (1952) and embraced the relatively new medium of television with several self-titled comedy shows and a first dramatic role in anthology ""Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Presents"" (Syndication, 1953-57). After returning to MGM for ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" (1960), Keaton was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 1960, enjoyed supporting roles in ""Pajama Party"" (1964), ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" (1965) and ""Sergeant Deadhead"" (1965) and sported his signature pork pie hat for his final silent film, ""The Railroader"" (1965). He then received a standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival for his performance as O in Samuel Beckett short ""Film"" (1965) before making his screen swansong playing next-door-neighbor Erronius in ancient Roman farce ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" (1966).

DeMille was a crucial figure in the early development of the classic Hollywood narrative filmmaking style. Although less critically revered than D.W. Griffith, DeMille actually played a more important role in shaping the structure of the Hollywood system with films like ""The Squaw Man"" (1914), ""Brewster's Millions"" (1914) and ""The Cheat"" (1915). The commercial success of ""The Cheat"" allowed DeMille to expand his creative scope to include the popular comedy ""Don't Change Your Husband"" (1919) and his first attempt at ""The Ten Commandments"" (1923). After leaving the silent era behind for the brave new world of talkies, DeMille embarked on a highly-profitable partnership with Paramount Pictures that enabled him to make his most memorable films. Among the best was ""Cleopatra"" (1934), which harkened the penchant for grandeur and large-scale epics that became synonymous with his name. Following a string of lesser works like his first Technicolor venture, ""Northwest Mounted Police"" (1940), ""Reap the Wild Wind"" (1942), starring John Wayne, and the flag-waving drama ""The Story of Dr. Wassell"" (1944), DeMille made three of what many considered to be his finest films: ""Samson and Delilah"" (1949), ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (1952) and his remake of ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). It was the latter film, with its cast of thousands and groundbreaking visual effects, that cemented DeMille's legacy as a true innovator who helped pioneer modern day epic filmmaking."

With the help of co-writer Raymond Chandler, he directed a masterpiece of film noir, ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), which he followed with ""The Lost Weekend"" (1945), a social drama that delivered an uncompromising look at alcoholism. After the great war drama ""Stalag 17"" (1953), Wilder created a variation on the comedy of manners and seduction in films such as ""Sabrina"" (1954) and ""Love in the Afternoon"" (1957), mixed black comedy and  farce for ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959) - his most entertaining movie - and alienated Hollywood with the cruel and haunting ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950).

Dreier was skilled at creating foreign locales on the studio lot, a talent frequently drawn on by European directors such as Josef von Sternberg, Rouben Mamoulian and Ernst Lubitsch. He was head of Paramount's design department from 1928 to 1951 and created the sets for 11 Cecil B. DeMille films between 1933 and 1949. A gifted artist and one of Hollywood's premiere art directors, Dreier worked with many major figures in his lengthy and distinguished career. To Dreier goes considerable credit for the lush Continental elegance and soft gradations of the gray scale which marked Paramount's distinctive black-and-white period of the 1920s and 30s. He proved equally adept at handling the changes of the 40s, from the demands of color in lavish period epics to the gloomy romanticism of film noir."

One of the film industry's pioneering professional women, she became a major American fashion force, designing for Vogue patterns and airlines as well. Her ability to shape each gown to a character or image made her as popular with film directors as with the glamour girls she dressed in both their private lives and screen roles. Yet the image she devoted the most work to was her own. Her friendly frankness led to regular appearances on Art Linkletter's daytime television show in the 1950s, offering fashion advice to audiences."

After graduating from prep school, Davis joined George Cukor's Rochester, NY-based stock theater company, through which she accrued parts in productions like ""Broadway"" and ""The Wild Duck"" in 1929. That same year, she made her Broadway debut with the play ""Broken Dishes."" The following year, Davis moved to Hollywood to transition to screen acting; her earliest film roles included ""The Bad Sister"" (1931) and ""Waterloo Bridge"" (1931). It was the following year that Davis earned her big break: a role in ""The Man Who Would Be God"" (1932), which launched her career in earnest. Her next big winner was ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934), which earned Davis her first Academy Award nomination. Her next nomination and first win came one year later with ""Dangerous"" (1935). Success followed Davis as she then appeared opposite Humphrey Bogart in ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936) and in ""Marked Woman"" (1937), and then won another Oscar for her work in ""Jezebel"" (1938). The following year was especially fortuitous for Davis, with box office smashes like ""Dark Victory"" (1939), ""The Old Maid"" (1939), ""Juarez"" (1939), and ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939). Likewise, successful pictures to follow included ""The Letter"" (1940) and ""The Little Foxes"" (1941). 1943 saw the death of Davis' then-husband Arthur Farnsworth, which led to a slight hiccup in her productivity. Following this, she endured poor reception to a series of her features, namely ""A Stolen Life"" (1946) and ""Beyond the Forest"" (1949). However, it was next that perhaps her most iconic role would find her: that of Margo in ""All About Eve"" (1950). Successes to follow would include ""The Star"" (1952), ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" (1962), and the family films ""Return from Witch Mountain"" (1978) and ""Watcher in the Woods"" (1980).

Her early films were not of consistent quality, but the lovely, husky-voiced actress usually managed to make a positive impression and showed genuine ability in pictures as varied as Orson Welles' ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), ""Five Graves to Cairo"" (1943) and ""The Razor's Edge"" (1946), winning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for the latter. However, she was best remembered for her indelible performances as a ruthless, success-driven young actress in ""All About Eve"" (1950) and the gorgeous and nefarious Nefretiri in Cecil B. DeMille's religious epic ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). The movie assignments offered to Baxter in the wake of those triumphs were often not worthy of her skills, but she still managed to give consistent and laudable performances, particularly in projects that suitably challenged her. Principal among these was ""Applause"" (1972), a musical re-working of ""All About Eve"" for the stage in which the now older Baxter successfully assumed the role of the character she had deceived in the film. It was that sort of versatility and professionalism that allowed Baxter to earn numerous credits in three different mediums over a career spanning almost 50 years."

Proficient at acting, singing and dancing, Holm was a natural for the movies and signed with 20th Century Fox in 1946, making her film debut in ""Three Little Girls in Blue"" (1946) before winning an Oscar for her supporting role in ""Gentleman's Agreement"" (1947). From there, she did especially fine work in ""Come to the Stable"" (1949) and ""All About Eve"" (1950), but Holm returned to the stage with ""Affairs of State"" (1950-52) and as a replacement lead performer in the Broadway juggernauts ""The King and I"" (1951-54), while appearing sporadically on screen in films like ""The Tender Trap"" (1955) and ""High Society"" (1956). Holm also worked frequently on television as a guest star and recurring performer on a handful of series that often only lasted a season, though she received acclaim for her work on ""Insight"" (Syndicated, 1960-1983) and ""Backstairs at the White House"" (NBC, 1979). Even after decades of distinguished work in a commendable variety of roles, which included one of her last appearances on the series ""Promised Land"" (CBS, 1996-99), Holm always displayed energy and conviction at an age when most performers happily settle into retirement and kept performing right into the next century."

A contract with 20th Century Fox gave Sanders a home base in Tinseltown but he often did his best work for other studios, including the villains of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" (1940) for United Artists, Joe May's ""The House of the Seven Gables"" (1940) for Universal, and as swank soldier of fortune Simon Templar in ""The Saint Strikes Back"" (1940) and its sequels at RKO Radio Pictures. After the war, Fox slotted the epicene actor into a string of handsomely-mounted period pieces, including John Braham's ""Hangover Square"" (1945), Albert Lewin's ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" (1945) and Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" (1947). Sanders won an Oscar for playing an acerbic theatrical critic in Mankiewicz's show biz satire ""All About Eve"" (1950), and his collaboration with neorealist pioneer Roberto Rossellini on the undervalued ""Viaggio in Italia"" (1954) marked what many considered to be his last great film performance. Widowed in 1969 and hobbled by a debilitating stroke that affected his speech, Sanders took his own life in Spain in 1972, drawing closed the curtain on the life of a consummate actor who could never completely camouflage his own fierce intelligence."

He came to prominence opposite future wife Bette Davis in a splendid performance as a cynical and hot-tempered but ultimately reasonable stage director in the backstage comedy-drama ""All About Eve"" (1950). A likable and reliable performer, he went on to play a number of earnest leads and secondary parts, mostly with 20th Century-Fox, through the 1970s. His 1988 autobiography ""Bette, Rita and the Rest of My Life"" chronicled his turbulent 10-year marriage to Davis (1950-60) and his affair with actor-dancer Rita Hayworth."

Born the comically alliterative Hugh Herbert Hipple in Philadelphia, the actor changed his name to the weightier Hugh Marlowe after beginning his stage career at Los Angeles' Pasadena Playhouse. After a brief stint in radio during the 1930s, Marlowe earned his first supporting roles as a contract player for 20th Century Fox. He was often cast as a humorless foil to leading men of the day, most notably opposite a jocular Carey Grant in the Howard Hawks-directed screwball comedy ""Monkey Business"" (1952). But his most memorable film contributions were in the sci-fi genre: on the groundbreaking 1951 film ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" the oft-spoofed 1956 B-film ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers,"" and the big-budget cinemascope extravaganza ""World Without End"" (1956).

Usually in the role of the sardonic chorus figure, strewing films with witty asides and cynical observations, Ritter enlivened a host of excellent productions and earned her place as one of the best character players the screen has ever known. Ritter earned six Academy Award nominations as best supporting actress: ""All About Even"" (1950), ""The Mating Season"" (1951), ""With a Song in My Heart"" (1952), ""Pickup on South Street"" (1953), ""Pillow Talk"" (1959), and ""The Birdman of Alcatraz"" (1962). Ritter's first screen role was in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) playing the mother sent from Macy's to Gimbel's by Kris Kringle. In ""All About Eve"" (1950), she was Birdie, the ex-vaudevillian (""I closed the first half for 11 years and you know it!""), who now is Margo Channing's maid and companion and who utters the immortal line, ""What a story. Everything but the bloodhounds yapping at her rear end."" That hard edge came to use in ""Titanic"" (1953), when she was the Unsinkable Molly Brown, playing cards as the ship begins to sink. In ""Rear Window"" (1954), she was Jimmy Stewart's housekeeper, in ""Pillow Talk"" (1959), her witticisms stole scenes from Doris Day, and in ""A Hole in the Head"" (1959), she was Frank Sinatra's understanding sister-in-law. In ""How the West Was Won"" (1962), Ritter was a spinster traveling to the west with Debbie Reynolds, and in ""A New Kind of Love"" (1963), a fashion designer alongside Joanne Woodward -- a job one might never imagine Ritter doing in real life. In film after film, her presence was the highlight of the picture, and although she was more than 40 before she stepped before a camera, Ritter eventually worked with virtually every major director of her period (Hitchcock, Mankiewicz, etc.) and every major star (Edward G. Robinson, Barbara Stanwyck, Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Montgomery Clift, etc.) stealing scenes from most of them. Ritter began working in TV regularly about the mid-50s. One of her earliest roles was in the 1955 ""Goodyear TV Playhouse: A Catered Affair,"" written by Paddy Chayefsky. In a role that was eventually played by Bette Davis on the big screen, Ritter was a mother who can't keep her daughter's wedding small. She appeared on other anthology programs and made occasional appearances on Jack Paar's late-night talk show."

Those same qualities helped to preserve her in the annals of Hollywood history after her untimely and controversial death in 1962, when she transcended the bounds of stardom to become an iconic figure discussed and celebrated in countless biographies and merchandise. Eventually, she became a prism for the world to view all manner of dichotomous socio-political issues: the heights and price of success, the adoration and exploitation of women, the truth and fiction behind the Hollywood dream. All of these elements kept Monroe relevant to pop culture and history, as well as economically viable, long after other celebrities had faded from memory. And though many studio-created sex symbols came before and after Monroe, it was her unique vulnerability - women wanted to be her; men wanted to protect her - that made her stand out from the crowd."

Murnau's ""The Last Laugh"" (1924).

After escaping a truly Dickensian childhood in England and paying his dues on the American vaudeville circuit, Grant landed his first leading roles in such features as ""She Done Him Wrong"" (1933). Having gained notoriety in romantic-comedies like ""The Awful Truth"" (1937), he went on to star opposite a cavalcade of Hollywood's most luminous leading ladies, including Irene Dunne, Ingrid Bergman, Ginger Rogers, Katharine Hepburn, Eva Marie Saint and Grace Kelly. Classics like ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938) paired the star with many of the greatest directors of the golden age of cinema, including Howard Hawks, George Cukor, Frank Capra, Stanley Donen and, most notably, Alfred Hitchcock. For nearly 30 years, Grant remained a major box office draw in hit films that included ""Gunga Din"" (1939), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940), ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1941), ""Notorious"" (1946), ""To Catch a Thief"" (1955), ""North by Northwest"" (1959) and ""Charade"" (1963). So indelible was his contribution to cinema that he was ranked No. 2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 25 Greatest Screen Legends of All Time in 1999, surpassed only by Humphrey Bogart.

An overnight sensation upon winning her first Academy Award for ""Morning Glory"" (1933), the headstrong actress soon chafed under the constraints of the male-dominated studio system. Brash and outspoken - she was one of the first American female celebrities to wear trousers - her prickly public image and a series of poor project choices earned her a reputation as ""box office poison"" until ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940) allowed her to take control over her career as few actresses had before. From then on, Hepburn carefully cultivated roles that were largely reflections of her own unique persona. She perfected the battle-of-the-sexes comedy formula with the love of her life, Spencer Tracy, in such films as ""Woman of the Year"" (1942) and ""Adam's Rib"" (1949), then entered a second phase of her career with the prim ""spinster"" roles first seen in ""The African Queen"" (1951). For many, these iconic performances would eventually outshine her earlier triumphs. Hepburn's final film with Tracy in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) won her another Oscar, as did her pairing with Peter O'Toole in ""The Lion in Winter"" (1968) and Henry Fonda in ""On Golden Pond"" (1981).

A highly-decorated bomber pilot during World War II, Stewart returned to motion pictures in Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). A film widely regarded as overly sentimental upon its initial release, it went on to become a beloved holiday classic decades later. Another nostalgic favorite, although more appreciated in its day, was Stewart's charming fantasy about a gentle man and his best friend - an invisible talking rabbit named ""Harvey"" (1950). In the decade that followed, however, Stewart set about redefining his naÃ¯ve screen persona with portrayals of troubled heroes in frequent collaborations with director Anthony Mann in rugged Westerns like ""Winchester 73"" (1950) and ""The Naked Spur"" (1953), as well as four remarkable films with Alfred Hitchcock that included ""Rear Window"" (1954) and ""Vertigo"" (1958).

After serving with honors in the Navy during World War II, Howard returned to less glamorous, and less central, film roles, though he did keep intermittently active from the late 1940s to the mid 1970s. He was an early adopter of television, meanwhile, making the rounds on numerous theater/playhouse shows starting in the late '40s, and in the latter '50s played two series leads: the title character on the medical drama ""Dr. Hudson's Secret Journal"" and as Commander John ""Pliny"" Hawk on ""Adventures of the Sea Hawk.""

Originally, it was one of Aparicio's sisters who was planning on auditioning for a secretive, prestigious film project, but she ended up being too far into a pregnancy to attend. She managed to convince Aparicio, who had just completed a degree in early childhood education and was passing time before starting her first teaching job, to audition in her place. Despite having no experience, or even any real interest, in acting, and going up against hundreds of other women who auditioned, writer/director Alfonso CuarÃ³n cast Aparicio in the starring role of his next film, ""Roma"" (2018). Named for the neighborhood in which CuarÃ³n grew up (in fact, the house in which most of the film takes place was literally right across the street from CuarÃ³n's childhood home), and shot in sumptuous black and white with scenes playing out in extended single takes, Aparicio starred as Cleo, the live-in maid to a middle-class Mexico City family who find their own personal trials and tribulations mirrored by the political unrest of 1970 and 1971: as student protesters clash violently with renegade bands of fascists in the streets, Cleo deals with an unwanted pregnancy, while the marriage at the center of the family she cares for falls apart. Premiering at the 2018 Venice International Film Festival, where it took home the Golden Lion, ""Roma"" wowed critics, many of whom praised Aparicio's quietly magnetic and naturalistic performance. ""Roma"" was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including a Best Actress nod for Aparicio, making her the first indigenous woman and only the second Mexican woman to ever be nominated in that category."

On stage, she had roles in the Spanish-language adaptations of plays by David Mamet and Harold Pinter. She moved into film with a part in the dark comedy, ""Hijas de su madre: Las Buenrostro"" (2005). Her profile jumped when she starred in Rodrigo Pla's festival favorite ""The Zone"" (2007). Roles followed in ""Love, Pain and Vice Versa"" (2008) and ""Nora's Will"" (2008). She went on to star in the TV romance ""S.O.S.: Sexo y ostros secretos"" (Canal5, 2007-08). She continued making appearances on television in programs such as ""Las Aparicio"" (Cadenatres, 2010) and ""Capadocia"" (HBO, 2008-12). On the big screen, she starred in the racing drama ""Desafio"" (2010) and ""Richness of Internal Space"" (2012).

The actress also joined the cast of the Mexican thriller ""Ingobernable"" (Netflix, 2017-) in a recurring role, playing special prosecutor Patricia Lieberman. She continued the heavy TV slate with a starring role in the police drama ""Falco"" (Telemundo, 2018-). Her film career took a turn for the better when she was tabbed by director Alfonso Cuaron for one of the leads in his celebrated semi-autobiographical film ""Roma."" de Tavira played the matriarch of the family that employs Yalitza Aparicio's earnest maid. The role earned the actress an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She followed with a role in the drama ""This Is Not Berlin"" (2019)."

A native of Mexico City, Mexico, he began making short-films while in college. After graduation, he began working in a variety of roles within the Mexican film and television industry. He was allowed behind the camera to direct, as well as write, multiple episodes of the horror anthology television show ""Hora Marcada"" (Las Estrellas, 1988-90). He graduated to directing features when he helmed the sex comedy ""Solo con Tu Pareja"" (1991). He entered the U.S. market when he directed an episode of the anthology series ""Fallen Angels"" (Showtime, 1993-95). He followed with his first English-language feature, ""A Little Princess"" (1995), an adaptation of the popular children's book. His next project was also based on a famous piece of literature when he brought a modernization of Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations"" (1998) to the screen. He returned to Mexico and set himself apart from many of his contemporaries when he wrote and directed ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (2001). The story of a pair of teenage boys on a road trip with an older, married woman found an audience across languages and earned international notice. It also earned Cuaron his first Academy Award nomination for writing. He jumped into big budget fare when he was tabbed to direct the third film in the ""Harry Potter"" series, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004). He joined a host of directors, including Alexander Payne and Gus Van Sant, in directing a segment of the film ""Paris, je t'aime"" (2006). His adaptation of the P.D. James dystopian novel ""Children of Men"" (2006) earned him a fresh round of acclaim. His next feature, though, helped him make history. Working from a script that he co-authored with his son, Jonas Cuaron, he directed Sandra Bullock and George Clooney in the space drama ""Gravity"" (2013). The film went on to win seven Oscars, including a win for its director. That made Cuaron the first Latin American filmmaker to achieve that honor. Turning to television, he created the short-lived fantasy drama ""Believe"" (NBC, 2014), which proved to be a rare misfire. He rebounded in grand fashion, however, in his return to feature directing. Based in part on his own experience as a youngster, ""Roma"" (2018), which he produced, wrote, directed, and edited, was hailed across the world. The film earned 10 Academy Award nominations, including Cuaron's second nods for both writing and directing."

Born in Rosh HaAyin, Israel, she was crowned Miss Israel in 2004. Due to conscription, Israeli citizens over the age of 18 are required to spend time in the army. Gadot spent her time split between modeling and the military, drawing international attention when she featured in Maxim's ""Women of the Israeli Army"" feature in 2007. That same year she made her acting debut on Israeli TV series ""Bubot"" (2007-08). However it was 2009 where she really made an impact when she was cast as Gisele in the fourth installment of the box-office phenomenon ""Fast & Furious."" In keeping with her military training, she also performed her own stunts. This was followed by smaller roles in the comedy series ""Entourage"" (HBO, 2004-2011), ""Date Night"" (2010) and ""Knight and Day"" (2010) before returning to the fold for ""Fast Five"" in 2011. She also found time to front several major advertising campaigns for fashion label Castro, Captain Morgan rum and Jaguar alongside a recurring role on Israeli comedy series ""Asfur"" (2010-2011). ""Fast & Furious 6"" (2013) saw Gadot return as Gisele, though it was her final go-round in the series. Dec. 4, 2013 saw the biggest announcement of Gadot's career so far when she was named as the new Wonder Woman, set to appear in ""Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) before the comic book superstar finally made her headlining debut in the long-delayed ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), co-starring Chris Pine and directed by Patty Jenkins.  The film was a massive critical and box office success, with Gadot's performance singled out by criticas and audiences alike. Gadot next appeared as Wonder Woman in the ensemble film ""Justice League"" (2017). As that film was released during a massive wave of publicity about sexual misconduct in Hollywood, Gadot made headlines by saying that she would not appear in the scheduled ""Wonder Woman 2"" unless producer Brett Ratner, whose career had been shadowed by misconduct allegations, was removed from the project."

The Danish actress received her start in French and Italian projects, but broke through internationally with a small role as Al Pacino's evil temptress sidekick in ""The Devil's Advocate"" (1997). She notched memorable supporting roles in ""Rushmore"" (1998), ""Soldier"" (1998) and ""Mission to Mars"" (2000) before landing the female lead of the Oscar-winning ""Gladiator"" (2000) opposite Russell Crowe. Her searing turn as the proud-but-powerless Lucilla, older sister of the corrupt emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) earned her raves, and she used her newfound fame to springboard into art house films with leading roles in the Robin Williams thriller ""One Hour Photo"" (2002) and the challenging ""Demonlover"" (2002). Nielsen won the Danish equivalent of the Oscar for her starring role in the drama ""BrÃ¸dre"" (""Brothers"") (2004), which was remade into an American film in 2009. Consistently cast as tough, powerful women, Nielsen memorably filled in during the maternity leave of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" (NBC, 1999- ) star Mariska Hargitay and co-starred in political drama ""Boss"" (Starz 2011-12) and Kevin Bacon serial killer drama ""The Following"" (Fox 2013-15), while co-starring in films as varied as Lars von Trier's controversial ""Nymphomaniac"" (2013) and comic book blockbuster ""Wonder Woman"" (2017).

After receiving her start on the daytime soap opera ""Santa Barbara"" (NBC, 1983-1994) as fan favorite Kelly Capwell, Wright broke out in the role of the defiant Princess Buttercup in director Rob Reiner's instant family classic ""The Princess Bride"" (1987). She began a rocky two-decade relationship with Sean Penn after co-starring with the tempestuous actor in the crime drama ""State of Grace"" (1990). Only four years later, Wright lit up the screen in what could have been an unforgiving role as Tom Hanks' one true love, Jenny, in the cultural phenomenon ""Forrest Gump"" (1994). After working under the direction of Penn for the first time in the harrowing drama ""The Crossing Guard"" (1995), she married the actor-director in 1996, thus beginning one of the more tumultuous on-and-off relationships in Hollywood. Wright appeared in a steady stream of mainstream and independent films, both with and without her talented husband, including ""She's So Lovely"" (1997), ""Message in a Bottle"" (1999), ""The Pledge"" (2001), ""A Home at the End of the World"" (2004) and ""Breaking and Entering"" (2006). After divorcing Penn in 2010, she reinvigorated her career with significant work in films like ""Moneyball"" (2011), ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (2011), ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) and ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), as well as drama series ""House of Cards"" (Netflix, 2013- ).

Throughout his career, the actor regularly showed an interest in heady, literary-inspired works, but he found his widest audience with a run of edge-of-your-seat blockbusters like ""30 Days of Night"" (2007), ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009) and ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), while portraying historical figures like King Richard the Lionheart in ""Robin Hood"" (2010) and the ancient Greek god of the ocean Poseidon in ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010) and ""Wrath of the Titans"" (2012).

As a true artist, Thewlis delved deeply into forms of expression other than the one that has earned him a living. Born in Blackpool, England, Thewlis spent a happy childhood filling diaries with ""words and sentences and poems"" - his first foray into an artistic life. Thewlis then explored music by playing in a punk band called Door 66. When the time came to decide his future, Thewlis chose to attend the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and graduated in 1985. It was while in school that Thewlis turned to acting. A slave to twin passions of music and acting, Thewlis performed Simon & Garfunkel songs in clubs in order to earn his equity card. Meanwhile, Thewlis began appearing in commercials and on stage and snared a few small roles in film and on British television, including the movie-of-the-week ""The Singing Detective"" (PBS, 1988), ""Skulduggery"" (1989) and ""Life Is Sweet"" (1990), directed by Mike Leigh. Though his role ""Life Is Sweet"" was small, Thewlis impressed Leigh enough to be cast for the lead role in ""Naked"" (1993). His performance as Johnny, a down-and-out, yet intelligent drifter in Manchester whose brutal treatment of women defies convention as he lives outside the social norm of late-20th century England, earned Thewlis several awards for best actor, including that of the New York Critics, National Society of Film Critics, and the London Film Critics Circle. Thewlis went on to amass a resume of divergent roles, ranging from kid's movies to dark independents to big budget Hollywood productions. His next role after ""Naked"" was opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Total Eclipse"" (1995), an indie drama about the turbulent relationship between French poets Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud. His next role became very special to the actor: as the voice of Earthworm in ""James and the Giant Peach"" (1996), Thewlis was subsequently asked on birthdays and other occasions to reprise his role for the children of friends and relatives. Next for Thewlis came ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" (1996), John Frankenheimer's attempt to put H.G. Wells' novel on screen. Thewlis next starred in ""Dragonheart"" (1996), playing Einon, a medieval king whose despotic reign belies the near-death promise he made when he was a boy. In April 1996, Thewlis directed a short film he wrote called ""Hello Hello Hello?"" (1998) and later received an honorable BAFTA Award nomination for his effort. Thewlis meanwhile continued acting, starring opposite Brad Pitt in ""Seven Years in Tibet"" (1997), or as the crew liked to call it, ""Five Years on This Set"". His performance didn't earn Thewlis any award nominations, but he was banned from ever visiting China. After a small role in the Coen Brothers' ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), Thewlis starred opposite Thandie Newton in ""Besieged"" (1999), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. In ""Gangster No. 1"", Thewlis plays an old associate of Gangster 55 (Malcolm McDowell) who gets released from prison after a 30-year stint. And in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004), Thewlis played Professor Remis Lupin in the third adaptation of the popular novels. To top off a busy period, Thewlis directed his first feature-length film, ""Cheeky"" (2003), a comedy that was shown at the London Film Festival and Toronto International Film Festival. Thewlis returned in front of the camera for ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005), playing a monk watching over the son (Orlando Bloom) of a knight (Liam Neeson) in this epic historical drama taking place in the relative calm between the 2nd and 3rd Crusades of the 12th century. He then had a supporting role in Terrence Malick's ""The New World"" (2005). Thewlis then signed on to appear in the sequel ""Basic Instinct 2"" (2006), starring Sharon Stone as the vampy novelist Catherine Tramell, who once again lures an unsuspecting man (David Morrissey) into a murderous trap. After a key role in the 2006 remake of horror classic ""The Omen,"" Thewlis starred as the title character in Paul Auster's little-seen drama ""The Inner Life of Martin Frost"" (2007) and reprised his role as the heroic Lupin in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007). In 2008, he had a supporting part in the Holocaust drama ""The Boy with the Striped Pajamas"" and subsequently returned to the Potter fold for ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009), as well as the concluding chapters of the fantasy saga ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" (2010) and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" (2011). With the Potter films continuing to bring in a sizeable paycheck, Thewlis was able to comfortably pursue smaller projects, including the drug-trade biopic ""Mr. Nice"" (2010), with Rhys Ifans, and ""London Boulevard"" (2010), a crime thriller starring Colin Farrell. Appearing in ""Anonymous"" (2011), another drama featuring Ifans, Thewlis stuck to other period pieces, portraying the husband of a dedicated Burmese politician in Luc Besson's ""The Lady"" (2011) and an unpleasant landlord in Steven Spielberg's World War I-era film ""War Horse"" (2011). Following a little time away from the spotlight, Thewlis revisited blockbuster fare, playing the enigmatic character of The Frog in the action sequel ""Red 2"" (2013). Supporting roles in Bill Condon's political thriller ""The Fifth Estate"" (2013), Terry Gilliam's ""The Zero Theorem"" (2013) and Stephen Hawking biopic ""The Theory of Everything"" (2014) followed in quick succession, followed by John Boorman's historical romantic drama ""Queen and Country"" (2014), psychological thriller ""Regression"" (2015) and the Tom Hardy-starring film about the notorious London gangsters the Kray twins, ""Legend"" (2015). After co-starring in Michael Fassbender's ""Macbeth"" (2015) as King Duncan, Thewlis appeared in comic book blockbuster ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) as Ares, the title character's adversary. That same year, Thewlis joined the cast of anthology series ""Fargo"" (FX 2015- ) for its third season."

Early in his career, Taghmaoui co-wrote (with his friend director Mathieu Kassovitz) and acted in the French drama ""La Haine."" In the film, Taghmaoui's character, also named SaÃ¯d, is one of three friends who find themselves alienated and at odds with a racist and anti-immigrant environment in France.

Taghmaoui played another figure at odds with the United States government in ""Traitor,"" as a member of a terrorist organization in Yemen who negotiates with the main character, played by Don Cheadle, working undercover as an arms dealer. In the political action thriller ""Vantage Point,"" Taghmaoui plays yet another terrorist, this time a leader named Suarez who tries to assassinate the president of the United States.

The film, which was largely shot in Scotland and initially released in Britain, also opened numerous opportunities for the young actor in Hollywood. In the years that followed, he appeared in military blockbusters like ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001) and ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001), while maintaining his indie roots with acclaimed performances in ""Snatch"" (2000) and ""Match Point"" (2005), the latter of which was directed by Woody Allen."

As an adult, he performed at Disneyland Paris as part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, doing stunt horseback riding as well as participating in battlefield reenactments. From there he returned to Canada, and did stunt work and performed small roles in such projects as ""Hell on Wheels"" (AMC, 2011-15) and ""The Revenant"" (New Regency, 2015). After years of hard work, his breakthrough role as Chief, one of Wonder Woman's key allies as she fights in the World War I trenches, brought him new attention and wide acclaim. He was also given input into the character, speaking Blackfoot to Wonder Woman to introduce himself and consulting on the design of his costume.

Born on February 17, 1973 in Solihull, England, Davis was the daughter of one of Britain's most beloved comedic actors, Jasper Carrott. It was on a series created by her father, a spoof of police dramas called ""The Detectives"" (BBC One, 1993-97), where Davis made her acting debut, appearing in a series one episode. She then went on to play Maria Lucas in the BBC's hugely successful miniseries adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (BBC, 1995), while also making an appearance in the 1996 Christmas special of the popular sitcom ""One Foot in the Grave"" (BBC, 1990-2000). Davis's breakout role came when she was cast as Dawn Tinsley, the quiet receptionist with artistic ambitions at the Slough branch of the Wernham Hogg Paper Company, in Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant's groundbreaking mockumentary sitcom ""The Office"" (BBC Two, 2001-2003). Though ratings for the series were initially sluggish, ""The Office"" eventually became a worldwide cult phenomenon, lasting for two series and a Christmas special, turning its creators and lead actors into legitimate stars, and leading to an even more successful American adaptation. After ""The Office"" ended, Davis went on to appear in another cult classic, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's horror comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004), in which she played Diane, a ditzy aspiring actress who is part of a contentious group held up in a local pub while a zombie apocalypse rages just outside. Before long, Davis's work in her home country was starting to earn her work on the other side of the pond: she enjoyed an arc on the first season of the popular sitcom ""Ugly Betty"" (ABC, 2006-2010), and was one of the leads on Aaron Sorkin's notorious misfire ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" (NBC, 2006-2007). Davis would continue to work in TV throughout the decade, appearing on such shows as ""Black Books"" (Channel 4, 2000-04), ""The Mentalist"" (CBS, 2008-2015), ""Family Guy"" (FOX, 1998-2002, 2005-), and ""Death in Paradise"" (BBC One, 2011-). Davis's next big role came in the form of Etta Candy, a beloved comic book character who had never been portrayed in live action before, in the acclaimed superhero summer blockbuster ""Wonder Woman"" (2017). Davis could next be seen playing Hilda Spellman on the tongue-in-cheek horror series ""The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" (Netflix, 2018-)."

At the same time, she was given her first movie role in 1996's ""Africa."" She was admitted to the college, but was quickly expelled because her filming schedule conflicted with her studies. In 2001, she had her breakthrough role in the erotic ""LucÃ­a y el sexo,"" directed by Julio Medem. For her performance, she was nominated for a Goya Award, the highest acting honor in Spain. That brought her to the attention of legendary director Pedro AlmodÃ³var, who cast her in ""Talk To Her."" She also crossed over into American films around this time, and she's probably still best-known for her role as Aleera, one of Dracula's wives, in the 2004 horror action flick ""Van Helsing.""

But unlike most first time directors, Jenkins knew the ins and outs of working on set before directing her first feature, ""Monster"" (2003), the true-life story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute executed in 2002 in Florida after being convicted of murdering six men. Despite her inexperience as a director, Jenkins elicited a bravura performance from her lead actress, Charlize Theron, who created a tremendous amount of Oscar buzz. Jenkins grew up in Kansas with Beat Generation heavies William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg as neighbors. A young Jenkins spent much of her spare time at the local cinema where she saw all kinds of movies. Though she later considered this her ""film education"", it never occurred to her at the time to be a filmmaker. After high school, Jenkins attended Cooper's Union in New York to study painting, but quickly traded her brushes for a camera package. Jenkins spent the next six years as a cameraperson on commercials and music videos for directors Tarsem and Brett Ratner. After this period, Jenkins moved to Los Angeles to attend the American Film Institute's Directing Program, where she made five short films that ranged in genre and form, including the female superhero short, ""Velocity Rules"" (2001). The short was selected to be shown at the 2001 AFT Fest. It was because of her entry into the AFI Fest that Jenkins was able to pitch her story about Wuornos, the first female serial killer to be executed in the state of Florida. Manager Brad Wyman liked the pitch and signed on to produce. Though they barely able to crack seven figures with the budget, Jenkins managed to score top talent to play her main character. In fact, Theron waived her usual fee in exchange for a producing credit, and later put up her own money for finishing costs. Meanwhile, Jenkins contacted Wuornos on death row in order to make sure that she would tell the story as accurately as possible-a result of the tabloid-style journalists who labeled Wuornos a monster fit to be killed. Wuornos was executed during pre-production, an event that strengthened Jenkins's resolve to tell her story in the most realistic and honest way as possible. The result of her hard efforts was a film that was hailed all around the festival circuit: it was nominated for three 2004 Independent Spirit Awards, and was voted one of the 10 best films of 2003 by the American Film Institute. Meanwhile, critics heaped praise on Theron, who became a top contended for an Oscar nod. Not bad for someone who just a few years ago didn't consider a career in filmmaking. Jenkins moved to television next, directing the made for TV film ""Five"" (Lifetime 2011) as well as the pilots for the mystery series ""The Killing"" (AMC 2011-13; Netflix, 2014) and ""Betrayal"" (ABC 2013-14). In April 2015, it was announced that Jenkins would replace original director Michelle MacLaren on the big-budget comic book film ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), which opened to enormously positive reviews and box office returns."

His credits include ""12 Monkeys"" (1995), ""Batman Begins"" (2005), ""Three Kings"" (1999) and ""American Hustle"" (2013), which he was nominated for Best Picture at the 2014 Academy Awards. But while Roven was responsible for major hits like ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) and ""City of Angels"" (1998), he also had some major flops on his record, including hip-hop duo Outkast's verture into period musical drama ""Idlewild"" (2006), the critically-panned heist thriller ""The Bank Job"" (2008) and a notorious Nicolas Cage flop, ""Season of the Witch"" (2011). Aside from his string of box-office successes, Roven was also known for being one of the targets of the Anthony Pellicano wiretap investigation, when Pellicano, a well-known private investigator, was hired by director John McTiernan, who was later charged in court with making false statements about the incident and spent some time in a federal prison as a result. In 1985, Roven married a fellow Hollywood power player, producer Dawn Steel. She rose through the ranks at Paramount to become one of the first women ever to run a major Hollywood studio. The couple had one child and remained together until Steel's death from brain cancer in 1997. Roven later remarried, to Stephanie Haymes, daughter of entertainers Dick Haymes and Fran Jeffries."

Romero, writer-director Zack Snyder set out to dazzle audiences from day one of his splashy career. Gaining a reputation as a tireless, inventive and efficient director of sleek commercials for companies like BMW and Nike throughout the 1990s, he eventually made the leap to feature films by directing a hyperkinetic reimagining of Romero's zombie classic ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004). Having turned a tidy profit on a modestly budgeted genre picture, Snyder far exceeded studio expectations with his next effort, the highly stylized Spartan epic, ""300"" (2007), a box-office smash based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. Nothing if not ambitious, Snyder went on to mount the big-screen adaptation of ""Watchmen"" (2009), the ground-breaking comic book miniseries written by Alan Moore. Looking to work on something fraught with less potential for controversy, he helmed the CGI family fantasy ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" (2010), then wrote, produced and directed the wildly self-indulgent genre mash-up spectacle ""Sucker Punch"" (2011), about a young girl (Emily Browning) who escapes the real world horrors of a mental asylum by retreating into her own fantasies. Resuscitating the Superman franchise with the highly-anticipated ""Man of Steel"" (2013) was merely one more make-or-break challenge for the director. Accused of favoring style over substance by his detractors, Snyder unapologetically offered up his films to the fans as pure popcorn entertainment."

Roles in television shows such as ""The Felony Squad"" (ABC, 1966-69) and ""The F.B.I.""

He experienced his first true breakthrough with the film ""Lifeguard"" (1976), playing a beach bum who reevaluates his life after attending his high school reunion. The actor also took advantage of the television miniseries craze, starring in ""Once an Eagle"" (NBC, 1976) and ""Aspen"" (NBC, 1977). His looks, including his trademark thick mustache, made him a natural for cowboy roles. He teamed with Tom Selleck for a pair of TV films based on Louis L' Amour books, ""The Sacketts"" (NBC, 1978) and ""The Shadow Riders"" (CBS, 1982), which became some of his most memorable roles in the genre.

He added another archetype to his repertoire - the elder, male mentor - when he joined Patrick Swayze for the surprise hit ""Road House"" (1989). He continued mixing roles in Westerns like ""Tombstone"" (1993) and ""Buffalo Girls"" (CBS, 1995), with more traditional dramas such as ""Rush"" (1991).

Clay, who was born Andrew Clay Silverstein, grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. As a young boy, Clay loved to entertain. He would impress both family and friends with his spot-on impressions of famous people, and by the age of 7 began playing the drums. He eventually became such a skilled drummer that by his early teens, Clay was performing regularly at bar mitzvahs and weddings in the Catskills club circuit. When he turned 20, however, Clay decided to take a crack at a career in standup comedy. He began performing impressions at clubs in his hometown neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and would leave audiences cracking up with his hilarious performances. One character in particular that Clay developed during this period was ""The Diceman,"" a foul-mouthed leather jacket wearing tough guy, who was kind of a wisecracking version of John Travolta's character in ""Grease"" (1978). In 1980 Clay relocated to Los Angeles, where there were far more opportunities for an upstart comic. He started performing his Diceman character on stage at the world famous Comedy Store on the Sunset Strip. His act caught the attention of Hollywood producers and casting agents, who subsequently cast Clay in film and TV parts. He made his film debut in the 1982 comedy ""Wacko,"" and in the ensuing years nabbed a small recurring role on ""Diff'rent Strokes"" (NBC, 1978-1986), a small role in John Hughes' ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986), and a recurring role on the NBC crime series ""Crime Story"" (NBC, 1986-88). Throughout the 1980s Clay performed his Diceman character in clubs all across the country, while developing a devoted following of fans. Then, in 1989, he released his first comedy album Dice (1989), which prominently featured the character, which made him an overnight sensation. Clay was featured on TV shows and in magazines, making him one of the most recognized comedians in the country. In 1990 he became the first comedian in history to sell out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row. 1990 was also the year Clay starred in the action-comedy film ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"" (1990). Clay's popularity as a standup hit a high point in the early 1990s, but by 1995 he had grown tired of The Diceman character. As a result, he decided to change his comedy act, so that he was talking about more personal issues, like his life as a father and husband. It was also around this period that Clay began focusing more on his film and TV acting. In 1995 he nabbed a starring role on the sitcom ""Bless This House"" (CBS, 1995-96). That series, however, was cancelled after a single season. Over the next 15 years Clay went on to appear in films like ""Whatever It Takes"" (1998) and ""Foolish"" (1999), as well as the reality series ""The Celebrity Apprentice 2"" (NBC, 2009), in which he was the first contestant to be fired by future U.S. President Donald J. Trump. Dice did not have any credited film or TV roles form 2002 to 2010, but in 2011 he slowly began making a comeback as a serious film and TV actor. In 2011, he played a down-on-his-luck version of himself on the final season of the HBO comedy-drama ""Entourage"" (HBO, 2004-2011), and two years later would go on to earn the best reviews of his career for his supporting role in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" (2013). In 2016 Clay played himself on the Showtime comedy series ""Dice"" (Showtime, 2016-17), but the series was cancelled after two seasons. Then, in 2018, Clay again received rave reviews for his role as the father of Lady Gaga's character in the Oscar-winning musical film ""A Star Is Born."" 2018 was also the year that Clay launched his very first podcast, ""I'm Ova Hea' Now."""

Though the surge in popularity that the show brought about was epic, Ramos had already been working hard and paying his dues in the world of musical theater when he won the part. Born in Brooklyn in 1991, Ramos' first love was baseball. Though he enjoyed singing in school ensembles, he had the highest batting average on his high school's baseball team, and planned to pursue the sport further until he landed a role in a school musical and discovered his new passion. Ramos participated in some community theater before earning a scholarship to attend the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. After graduating in 2011, he appeared in several plays, including a New Jersey production of ""Grease"" and a nationally touring production of ""Damn Yankees."" He eventually won a role in Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""In the Heights,"" which began a working relationship between the two. Ramos created the role of Laboy for himself in Miranda's 2014 short musical ""21 Chump Street,"" and in 2015, was cast in the roles of John Laurens and Philip Hamilton in ""Hamilton.""

Chappelle's sketch series became a cultural phenomenon during its short run, thanks to unforgettable and hilarious sketches like Black Bush, a  blind white supremacist who was actually black, and his parody of both Lil' Jon and pop icon Rick James, whose catchphrase, ""I'm Rick James, Bitch!"" entered the cultural zeitgeist. Despite the show's enormous popularity, Chappelle cracked under the pressure of stressful conditions and loss of creative control, leading to his abrupt departure at the start of the third season. After a brief departure from the public spotlight, he returned to his first love, stand-up, where Chappelle continued to prove his dominance while still maintaining his large and loyal fan base."

She plugged away for a good while, slowly building an audience, until things finally blew up for her in a big way. Born on June 1, 1981 in Ravensdale, Washington, Carlile began writing songs and singing while in her teens. After coming up on the Seattle music scene, she released her self-titled debut album on Columbia in 2005, but sales were modest. The follow-up record, 2007's T-Bone Burnett-produced The Story, gained a wider audience and higher chart placing, with the title track becoming a minor hit. A decade later, benefitting from Carlile's subsequent success, the album would achieve Gold status. 2009's Give Up the Ghost did better still, hitting No. 26 in the Top 200. Overseen by another star producer, Rick Rubin, the album featured an appearance by Elton John (an early hero of Carlile's) on ""Caroline."" A big breakthrough came with Carlile's next album, 2012's Bear Creek, which went all the way to No. 10 and gave the singer/songwriter a No. 4 hit on Triple A radio with the single ""That Wasn't Me."" Carlile earned her first Grammy nomination, for Best Americana album, with her next record, The Firewatcher's Daughter. The album, which marked her departure from Columbia and the beginning of her relationship with ATO Records, included an appearance from Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready, and charted No. 9 on the Top 200 while hitting the top spot on the rock and folk charts.

Prior to his small screen success, Rifkin was predominantly a theater actor who made occasional forays into features while starring on a seemingly endless string of short-lived television shows, beginning with the early-1970s sitcom, ""Adam's Rib"" (ABC, 1973). For several years, he struggled to find his footing in the acting world, as he landed numerous guest stints and small feature roles that failed to add up to a significant career. Rifkin had a few shining moments with recurring parts on ""One Day at a Time"" (CBS, 1975-1984) and ""Falcon Crest"" (CBS, 1981-1990). But his need to gain financial security led him to leave acting altogether during the mid-1980s so he could make a living selling coats designed by his father. The pull of acting proved too great, however, which led to a triumphant return to the stage with his award-winning performance in ""The Substance of Fire"" (1991). The role earned him considerable attention and eventually led to a rejuvenated career that included prominent co-starring turns in big studio films like ""L.A.

A charter member of Abrams' informal repertory company of players, Grunberg appeared in several of the director's earliest projects, beginning in elementary school. This friendship eventually resulted in a professional association that would continue long after both men's careers had become famously established, with Grunberg's star-making turn as the telepathic Matt Parkman on the superhero hit series ""Heroes"" (NBC, 2006-10) during the show's four-season run.

It was not until his Oscar-winning adaptation of ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) that Roth began to emerge as a prominent Hollywood scribe. But his career almost took a turn toward disaster with his next film, ""The Postman"" (1997), a sci-fi epic that proved to be almost ruinous for all involved, especially Roth, who had, up to that point, a trail of failures and only one success. Things began an upward trajectory that rarely wavered off course when he wrote the excellent drama, ""The Insider"" (1999), which earned critical kudos for its complex and richly developed tale about a real-life whistleblower who risks everything to tell the truth about the tobacco industry.

But it was his first feature film ""Road Trip"" (2000) that put Phillips on the map as a narrative filmmaker.

Hader later showed impressive range, starring in the dysfunctional sibling drama ""The Skeleton Twins"" opposite fellow SNL vet Kristen Wiig and co-starring in the Pixar animated hit ""Inside Out"" (2015). On television, Hader reteamed with fellow SNL alums Fred Armisen and Seth Meyers to create and star in the mockumentary series ""Documentary Now"" (IFC 2015- ), in which Hader and Armisen parody various famous documentary films."

Black turned the role of the angry curmudgeon railing against the injustices of our times into a cottage industry, becoming a favorite among an increasingly skeptical and cynical audience that has ranged in age from teenagers to the elderly. Prior to ""The Daily Show,"" Black toiled in stand-up comedy, performing at clubs and venues across the United States, while trying desperately to become a successful playwright. But it was his grumbling grouse character developed over the years in front of a microphone, that finally launched Black into celebrity, a slow process that brought the comedian eventual triumph at twice the age of other comedians around him. Although Black left ""The Daily Show"" in early 2016, he continued his stand-up and writing careers, as well as taking on high profile voice gigs such as playing the emotion Anger in Pixar's ""Inside Out"" (2015)."

She was hired as part of the original writing staff for ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-13) and, as with many of the show's writers, was given a recurring character to play. Her on-screen part, Kelly Kapoor, would end up appearing in 161 of the show's 188 episodes. On the big screen she had small parts in the comedies ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005), ""License to Wed"" (2007), and ""Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian"" (2009). After leaving ""The Office,"" she created and starred in the sitcom ""The Mindy Project"" (Fox/Hulu, 2012-17). Playing lovelorn Dr. Mindy Lahiri, she struck a strong connection with female audiences. She also garnered additional recognition as a writer with her humorous memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?. Firmly established as an actress, she joined Oprah Winfrey in ""A Wrinkle in Time"" (2018) and Sandra Bullock for ""Oceans 8"" (2018). As a producer, she created the short-lived sitcom ""Champions"" (NBC, 2018) and the TV adaptation of the British rom-com classic ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (Hulu, 2019- ).

The short was directed by Karl Ford, and follows a young woman's journey through the desert west. Two years later Dias was given her second role, as Jenny in the Julio Saldarriaga movie ""The Shifting.""  Dias scored her highest profile role to date when she lent her voice to the character of Riley in the Pixar movie ""Inside Out"" (2015).  The movie is the story of a young girl whose core emotions -- Joy, Fear, Sadness, Anger and Disgust -- are personified by different characters who attempt to help Riley manage the challenges of life.

But Tinseltown generally failed to match Lane's classical training with deserving roles, and the young actress found herself facing a career centered on her sex appeal. Instead, Lane opted for the stronger female characters often found in television movies and independent films, eventually enjoying the bulk of her critical success in more mature roles after the age of 35, when the adulterous drama, ""Unfaithful"" (2002) landed the actress firmly on the A-list map after more than 20 years of quality work. Enjoying her ""second act,"" the newly appreciated actress landed starring roles in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" (2003), ""Must Love Dogs"" (2005) and ""Hollywoodland"" (2006), while cementing her acting bona fides with ""Secretariat"" (2010) and ""Cinema Verite"" (HBO, 2011), making Lane one of the more highly sought actresses working in Hollywood.

Luckily for MacLachlan, he had a guardian angel in David Lynch, the visionary director who had cast him in the adaptation of the classic science fiction novel. Lynch would give MacLachlan the starring role in his next film, ""Blue Velvet"" (1986) and a lead role on the surrealistic television series ""Twin Peaks"" (ABC, 1990-91). The former would eventually be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece, while the latter became an instant sensation during its first season. Big box office success, however, continued to elude MacLachlan with overlooked vehicles like the sci-fi thriller ""The Hidden"" (1987) and Oliver Stone's Jim Morrison biopic ""The Doors"" (1991), as well as co-starring in the laughing stock that was ""Showgirls"" (1995), which later developed a rabid cult following. MacLachlan would make a modest return to notoriety on television with recurring parts as the wealthy, impotent husband of Charlotte York on ""Sex and the City"" (HBO, 1998-2004), and later on Marc Cherry's campy ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC, 2004-12). While MacLachlan became known as a respected working actor, continuing to appear in film and episodic television, a sense of unfinished business remained for years, until Lynch and co-creator Mark Frost announced ""Twin Peaks: The Return"" (Showtime 2017), a complex and at times divisive ""movie in 18 parts"" that featured MacLachlan in multiple roles associated with his signature character of FBI special agent Dale Cooper."

The Del Carmen family was plunged into poverty. Del Carmen's father would emigrate to the United States a few years later, hoping to find opportunities to improve his family's situation, Meanwhile, Del Carmen worked and saved, and eventually enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas a few years behind his peers. After graduating, he worked in advertising until the day he heard from his father again, asking him to join him in America. The move meant starting his career over, but he decided to take the risk. While he found no opportunities in the U.S. in his own field, he eventually found work in animation, an area he had long had interest in, but never pursued professionally. He began working in the animation department on the show ""Where's Waldo?"" (CBS, 1991), and quickly moved on to projects like the critically acclaimed ""Batman: The Animated Series"" (Fox, 1992-1995). In 2000, he joined the team at Pixar.

Displaying an ear for evoking strong classic themes that still felt new and energetic, his first big break was the music for director Brad Bird's Pixar hit ""The Incredibles"" (2004), an ode to 1960s style James Bond themes and other classic adventures.

While he certainly made a lot of money for his studio bosses, Bay earned considerable scorn from critics and other detractors, who deplored his testosterone-fueled action vehicles that were full of incessantly moving camerawork and frenetic editing, as well as short on story and three dimensional characters. Bay first made waves in the commercial world with his CLIO-winning ""Got Milk?"" ad campaign, while helping to reinvigorating the music career of artists like Donny Osmond with high-end music video work. But he made his biggest splash - which included a healthy amount of criticism - with his first movie, ""Bad Boys"" (1995), which featured tons of car chases, snappy one-liners and flying bullets. He followed his successful Hollywood entrÃ©e with ""The Rock"" (1996), a high-octane action thriller that had as many fans as it did critics. Bay was roundly criticized for the impossible-to-believe ""Armageddon"" (1998), which centered around a space shuttle landing on an asteroid hurtling toward Earth, while his take on ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) drew fire for its lazy accounting of historical events and overly sappy love story. Despite his detractors, Bay's movies were big box office earners until he made ""The Island"" (2005), which not only became his first flop, but also generated a lawsuit for allegedly ripping off the plot of an obscure 1976 movie. Bay bounced back, however, with ""Transformers"" (2007), a highly-successful and positively received adaptation the 1980s cartoon that spawned several sequels and retained Bay's title as being one of Hollywood's biggest hit makers."

His quick-witted performance as Alec Hardison, a geeky electronics expert, quickly made the sci-fi-loving whiz-kid a fan favorite character. After the series finale in 2012, Hodge was cast as an anarchist hacker in the political spy drama ""The East"" and reunited with Edwin in the financially successful but critically panned ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" (2013). Along with a recurring role in the historical series ""Turn: Washington's Spies"" (AMC 2014-17), Hodge appeared as MC Ren in the NWA biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" (2015). Along with high-profile supporting roles in historical drama ""Hidden Figures"" (2016) and Tom Cruise action sequel ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016), Hodge co-starred on Civil War drama ""Underground"" (WGN America 2016-17) as one of the leaders of the Underground Railroad that smuggled escaped slaves to safety in the north prior to the Civil War."

An accomplished musician and graduate of Yale's drama program, he began picking up minor roles on shows like ""New York Undercover"" (Fox, 1994-98) and features such as ""The Siege"" (1998). When he won the role of John Basil, an undercover cop trying to break up a drug operation in the vaunted prison drama ""Oz"" (HBO, 1997-2003), Reddick made a lasting impression that led to larger parts in other highly regarded series. He gained ardent admirers with his portrayal of dedicated police officer Lieutenant Cedric Daniels in the universally hailed police drama ""The Wire"" (HBO, 2002-08), before segueing into the more ambiguous role of ""fixer"" Matthew Abaddon for the fourth and fifth seasons of the cultural phenomenon ""Lost"" (ABC, 2004-2010). It all led to Reddick joining the regular cast of creator J.J. Abrams' science fiction procedural ""Fringe"" (Fox, 2008-2013) as Homeland Security Agent Phillip Broyle, head of a secret paranormal investigatory task force, as well as supporting roles in action thriller ""White House Down"" (2013) and police procedural ""Bosch"" (Amazon 2015- ). While physical strength and emotional intensity became hallmarks of Reddick's characters, his ability to convince - whether cast as a hero, a villain or someone less clearly defined - ensured Reddick continued success as a supporting actor and potential leading man."

He was often seen in street-smart character roles for directors like Martin Scorsese, Hal Hartley and Spike Lee, with whom he also co-scripted and co-produced the crime feature, ""Summer of Sam"" (1999). Memorable for his ability to imbue a likeable quick wit into otherwise dark and dangerous characters, Imperioli also had significant talent off-camera, penning scripts for ""The Sopranos,"" founding a New York theater company, and eventually writing and directing his own independent features."

Graduating into more adult roles in the late 1960s, Bridges was a diversely talented actor who fit comfortably into a number of genres - drama, comedy, historical biopics, and even science-fiction. Following a praised turn as reporter in ""Gaily, Gaily"" (1969) and a starring role in Hal Ashby's directorial debut, ""The Landlord"" (1970), he made his first of several collaborations with director Peter Ustinov in the satirical comedy, ""Hammersmith Is Out"" (1972). Later in the decade, Bridges was the husband of union organizer ""Norma Rae"" (1979) and entered the following decade with a starring role in the biopic ""Heart Like a Wheel"" (1983). He joined his brother for the critically hailed romantic drama, ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" (1989), which he followed with an Emmy-winning performance in the title role for ""Without Warning: The James Brady Story"" (HBO, 1991). Bridges also found great success on the small screen, earning critical acclaim for portraying Elvis' manager Colonel Tom Parker, former U.S. President Richard Nixon, and 19th century showman P.T. Barnum. Entering the new millennium, Bridges showed no sign of slowing down with a recurring role on ""Stargate: SG-1"" (Sci-Fi Channel, 2005-07), a supporting part in Steven Soderberg's World War II drama, ""The Good German"" (2006), and a guest-starring role on ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC, 2004-12). With his modest gravitas, which always made him a favorite of his many collaborators, Bridges quietly became one of the most prolific character performers working in Hollywood."

Her mother, Gloria, was a special education teacher, while her father, Thomas, was an electrician. She also had a younger sister, Reina. Her parents split in 1979, when King was eight years old. While attending Westchester High School, King began acting professionally: her first gig ever was a recurring role on the popular sitcom ""227"" (NBC, 1985-1990), playing Brenda Jenkins. She would play the role for the entire run of the series, graduating from high school in the middle of the show's fourth season. King continued to mix acting and academics: she began classes at University of Southern California while making her film debut in writer/director John Singleton's groundbreaking debut feature ""Boyz n the Hood"" (1991), a sobering look at teenage life in South Central L.A. King would go on to appear in Singleton's next two films as well, ""Poetic Justice"" (1993), and ""Higher Learning"" (1995). That same year, King also co-starred in another look at a day in the life of South Central, albeit a much more laid back and comedic one: ""Friday"" (1995) quickly became a comedic cult classic, and one of the most beloved stoner comedies of the decade. King next co-starred alongside Martin Lawrence in the dark romantic comedy ""A Thin Line Between Love and Hate"" (1996), before taking on a scene-stealing turn as Marcee Tidwell, wife to Cuba Gooding Jr.'s would-be football superstar in the smash hit ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996). King then went on a run of supporting roles alongside superstar black actors, playing Will Smith's wife in the espionage thriller ""Enemy of the State"" (1998), Chris Rock's love interest in the ""Heaven Can Wait"" remake ""Down to Earth"" (2001), and Eddie Murphy's wife in the family comedy ""Daddy Day Care"" (2003). In between supporting roles in two hit comedy sequels, ""Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde"" (2003) and ""Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous"" (2005), King found time to play Margie Hendricks, backup singer and drug-addled mistress to Jamie Foxx's Ray Charles in the smash hit biopic ""Ray"" (2004). Around this time, King began to pivot back towards TV gigs: she voiced Riley and Huey Freeman on Adult Swim's subversive ""The Boondocks"" (Cartoon Network, 2005-2014), played Sandra Palmer, sister of slain president David Palmer, on season 6 of ""24"" (FOX, 2001-2010), starred as Detective Lydia Adams on the critically acclaimed police procedural ""Southland"" (ABC, 2009/TNT, 2010-13) (she also directed a few episodes), and took on a recurring role as Janine Davis, Human Resources administrator, on the smash hit sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"" (CBS, 2007-2019). King then joined the cast of John Ridley's anthology series ""American Crime"" (ABC, 2015-2017), which told a different hot-button story every season using the same cast. King was awarded the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress, TV movie or Limited Series for her work two years in a row, on seasons one and two. After ""American Crime"" was cancelled following its third season, King moved on to another socially conscious drama, playing the mother of a murdered black teenager on the Netflix series ""Seven Seconds"" (Netflix, 2018-), for which she won a third Primetime Emmy, this time for Outstanding Actress, TV Movie or Limited Series. King would receive some of the best reviews of her career for her deeply humanistic performance in ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" (2018). An adaptation of a 1974 novel by James Baldwin from ""Moonlight"" (2016) writer/director Barry Jenkins, King played Sharon, the matriarch who lead the charge to clear the name of Fonny (Stephan James), the true love of her daughter Tish (KiKi Layne), after his unjust arrest for a rape he could not have committed. Amongst the many accolades King received for her work was a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. King's first post-Oscars project was a lead role in the TV adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel ""Watchmen"" (HBO, 2019-)."

Born on April 3, 2003 in Riverside, CA, Fisher began her career in show business when she was only five years old, making a cameo appearance on a 2009 episode of ""Medium"" (CBS, 2009-2011). The next year she solidified her voiceover bona fides when she starred as Agnes in the smash hit animated family comedy ""Despicable Me"" (2010), while also making her live action film debut in the indie coming of age drama ""Dirty Girl"" (2010). Fisher then went on to reprise the role of Agnes in the equally successful sequel ""Despicable Me 2"" (2013), while also taking on live action roles in the films ""Bad Behavior"" (2013), ""Vertical"" (2013), and ""McFarland, USA"" (2015). Her next role, however, in comedian Bo Burnham's directorial debut ""Eighth Grade,"" proved to be a watershed moment in her young career. In the film, Fisher plays Kayla, a teen girl who wrestles with her own insecurities over the film's titular year. ""Eighth Grade"" proved to be an indie smash, earning rave reviews and doing surprisingly respectable numbers at the box office. Critics were especially enamored with Fisher's naturalistic, relatable performance, to the point where her name was bandied around as a wild card for an Oscar nod. Meanwhile, Fisher continued to work, lining up a few notable projects, including parts in a new animated film adaptation of ""The Addams Family"" (2019), and a leading role in ""The Shaggs"" (2019), a biopic of the Wiggin sisters, who formed what is commonly considered to be the worst rock band in history."

Born Robert Pickering Burnham on August 21, 1990 in Hamilton, Massachusetts, he was the youngest of three children by construction company owner Scott Burnham and his wife, Patricia, who worked as a nurse. While a student at St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Masssachusetts, the teenaged Burnham began writing and performing satirical songs, including ""My Whole Family (Thinks I'm Gay)"" and ""Klan Kookout."" Though the topics were decidedly - and deliberately - outrageous and politically incorrect, Burnham's faux-wholesome delivery and button-down appearance, as well as the choice of his own bedroom and family as backdrop, did much to defang the potentially offensive nature of the material. He began posting the songs to YouTube and other social media sites in 2006, where they garnered millions of hits. Their popularity led to a contract with Comedy Central, which yielded his television debut at 18 on a segment of the 2008 special ""The World Stands Up"" and his self-titled debut comedy album in 2009. Writer-director Judd Apatow soon tapped him to collaborate on a parody of the popular ""High School Musical"" franchise (Disney Channel, 2004-07), and while the project did not come to fruition, Burhnam made his feature film debut with a cameo in Apatow's ""Funny People"" (2009). After recording his first one-hour comedy special, ""Bo Burnham: Words, Words, Words"" (Comedy Central, 2010), Burnham began work on developing a comedy series, ""Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous"" (MTV, 2013); the comedy, about a naÃ¯ve teenager who sets out to become a celebrity despite his lack of discernable talent, debuted on MTV in 2013 but lasted only a season. Undaunted, Burnham returned to a steady schedule of touring and recording comedy albums and specials, including 2013's what. and 2016's ""Bo Burnham: Make Happy"" (Netflix), while also expanded his acting resume with supporting roles in the critically acclaimed ""The Big Sick"" (2017) and ""Rough Night"" (2017). The following year, he scored a personal and professional triumph by writing and directing ""Eighth Grade"" (2018). The comedy-drama, inspired by his own teenage years, followed a socially anxious teen (played by Elsie Fisher) as she navigated the emotional upheaval prior to high school through a series of comic advice vlogs. The film earned Burnham an Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay and the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding First-Time Feature and Writers Guild Award for Best Original Screenplay. The success of the film led to a diverse array of assignments, from writing songs for a ""Sesame Street"" (PBS/HBO, 1969-  ) movie musical to acting in ""Promising Young Woman"" (2019) an ensemble drama starring Carey Mulligan for director Emerald Fennell (""Killing Eve,"" BBC America, 2016- )."

In an age when the ""legitimate"" theater held firm to primacy over motion pictures, and classical theater over modern, Laurence Olivier crossed seamlessly between both, even bridging the gap between popular culture and the Shakespearean and classic drama canon of which he was master. His legacy as the definitive Heathcliff and Hamlet, his acclaim even a generation later as the vengeful cuckold in ""Sleuth"" (1972) and a ruthless Nazi doctor in ""Marathon Man"" (1976), would see him earn 14 Oscar nominations, three statues, five Emmys out of nine nominations, two British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards out of 10 nominations - only a few indicators of his titanic impact on his craft and indeed on Western culture."

Following well-received appearances in the George Stevens epic-adventure ""Gunga Din"" (1939) and George Cukor's ""The Women"" (1939), Fontaine wowed audiences with her performance in Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller """"Rebecca"" (1940). The following year, she reteamed with Hitchcock and ""Gunga Din"" co-star Cary Grant for a starring role in ""Suspicion"" (1941), which won the actress an Academy Award. Over the next decade, she played romantic leads opposite cinema's greatest male stars in such films as ""Jane Eyre"" (1943) with Orson Welles and ""Ivanhoe"" (1952) alongside Robert Taylor. Gradually, Fontaine's career trajectory led her to roles as formidable older woman in projects like ""Island in the Sun"" (1957) and ""Tender is the Night"" (1962). Married four times, her husbands included ""Batman"" (ABC, 1966-68) producer-narrator William Dozier, and the reputed sibling rivalry between her and de Havilland kept Hollywood gossips' tongues wagging for decades. In the years after her retirement from film, Fontaine continued to appear in such stage productions as the Broadway comedy ""Forty Carats"" and went on to earn an Emmy nomination for her guest turn on the soap opera ""Ryan's Hope"" (ABC, 1975-1989). One of the brightest stars of Hollywood's Golden Era, Fontaine was widely remembered  as an actress of exceptional talent and a person of tremendous passion.

Anderson made her film debut in 1933 and played the sinister housekeeper Mrs. Danvers in Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" seven years later. It was the first, and most memorable, in a series of malevolent character roles that made good use of her commanding presence.

Over the course of 14 feature films, the pair battled everything from a seemingly supernatural menace on the English moors to Nazis undermining the American war effort. In contrast to his literary counterpart, Bruce's Watson abetted as much as aided that process, but he and Holmes remained inseparable friends and Bruce's loveable bumbler endeared himself to audiences around the world. Even before he was cast as Watson, the gregarious Englishman had already made a name for himself both on stage and film playing various colonels, dukes, and aristocrats, blowhards virtually to a man, but appealingly so, thanks to Bruce's comedic talents. Over a long career, the actor's talents also enhanced such notable features as ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"" (1936), and Alfred Hitchcock thought enough of his countryman's abilities to cast him in both ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Suspicion"" (1941). Sherlock Holmes aficionados may have objected to the way in which Bruce's older and chubbier Watson - whom they nicknamed ""Boobus Britannicus"" - was used mainly for comic relief and to help advance the narrative, but few would take issue with the actor's personification of the character as written, a wonderful mix of innocence and pomposity that provided a nice contrast to the sagacity and self-assurance of his famous partner."

Cooper's haughty, patrician demeanor was used to great effect in much of his work during this period. Arguably his most famous role came in 1938 when he starred in the sweeping action film ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" playing the gutless High Sheriff of Nottingham opposite the dashing Errol Flynn and the nefarious Basil Rathbone. Cooper re-teamed with Flynn and Rathbone again in the World War I aerial combat film ""The Dawn Patrol,"" released that same year.

Born in Essex in 1899, Hitchcock was studying engineering at London County Council School of Engineering and Navigation when, in 1914, his father died suddenly, prompting him to drop out in order to help support his family. Highly interested in the then new industry of film production, he made his first foray into movie making when he was hired at the London branch of Famous Players-Lasky as a title card designer. There, he gained experience in writing, editing, and production management, and was eventually assigned his first film as a director, ""The Pleasure Garden"" (1925). Collaborating with his wife, the writer, script supervisor, and editor Alma Reville almost from day one, Hitchcock would make a name for himself as a director just a short while later with his first thriller, ""The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog"" (1927). After directing England's first talkie, 1929's ""Blackmail"" (1929), Hitchcock began churning out a number of high-tension films that would soon become classics, including ""The 39 Steps"" (1935) and ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938). Eventually, he would relocate to Hollywood, making his American film debut with the Selznick International Pictures mystery ""Rebecca"" (1940) in 1940. Even more iconic thrillers would follow including ""Notorious"" (1946), ""Dial M For Murder"" (1954), ""Rear Window"" (1954), and ""To Catch a Thief"" (1955). In 1955, Hitchcock expanded his reach into television, producing and hosting the anthology series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" (CBS, 1955-1965). He would remain best known as a filmmaker however, directing beloved films like ""Vertigo"" (1958), ""North by Northwest"" (1959), and perhaps the most venerated thriller of all time, ""Psycho"" (1960). Hitchcock's output would slow during the '60s and '70s as he experienced health problems, with his final film ""Family Plot"" (1976) released in 1976. Hitchcock passed away on April 29, 1980.

The talented performer made the rounds in Chicago's club circuit before landing a coveted spot on the iconic sketch comedy series, ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ); first as a writer and then a cast member. Sudeikis quickly gained a huge fan base with his memorable portrayals of an ESPN sportscaster promoting feminine hygiene products, or of an annoying preppy with zero social skills. One of his biggest fans was the equally talented ""SNL"" alum, Tina Fey, who cast Sudeikis as her one-true-love interest on her hit series, ""30 Rock"" (NBC, 2006-13). As he savored his small screen success, he also began racking up supporting roles in feature films like ""What Happens in Vegas"" (2008), ""Semi-Pro"" (2008), and ""Going the Distance"" (2010). A starring role in the dark comedy ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011) pitted Sudeikis against more seasoned actors like Jamie Foxx, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston, and established him not only as an A-list comedian but positioned him to become a bankable movie star. Starring roles in broad comedies like ""We're the Millers"" (2013) and ""Masterminds"" (2016) followed, but Sudeikis also maintained a presence in TV, appearing in Will Forte's absurdist ""The Last Man on Earth"" (Fox 2015- ) and starring in the partially-animated sitcom ""Son of Zorn"" (Fox 2016- )."

After several years as a guest star on several popular shows, Kudrow skyrocketed to superstardom alongside her five cast mates on the immensely successful sitcom ""Friends"" (NBC, 1994-2004). For ten seasons, fans of the show delighted in Kudrow's deft portrayal of the naÃ¯ve, but strangely wise Phoebe Buffay, a masseuse and struggling folk singer who seemingly once lived an impossibly storied life, complete with being homeless throughout her entire adolescence. But unlike her five co-stars, Kudrow actively sought to subvert the image she created onscreen by tackling a diverse range of characters in features, including an excellent performance as a sexually repressed spinster in ""The Opposite of Sex"" (1998), though she sometimes catered to that ditzy image, as she did in the popular comedy, ""Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion"" (1997). Nonetheless, Kudrow managed to break away from her Phoebe persona following the show's exit in 2004, though the critically-acclaimed series ""The Comeback"" (HBO, 2005) was more of a cult phenomenon than her previous mainstream success. However, Kudrow began to thrive on the margins: while appearing in popular films like ""Easy A"" (2010) ""Neighors"" (2014) and its sequel ""Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising"" (2016) and the thriller ""The Girl on the Train"" (2016), Kudrow created and starred in improvised comedy webseries, ""Web Therapy"" (2008-14). A modified TV version ran on Showtime from 2011 to 2015, giving the star new popularity and once again confirming the diversity of her talent."

The actor made his television debut as a cast member of the iconic late night variety show, ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ) where he made viewers laugh week after week with spot-on celebrity impersonations and original, off-kilter characters. One of Forte's most memorable ""SNL"" roles was a hapless, mullet-sporting special ops agent named MacGruber.  The sketches, which lampooned the hit action series ""MacGyver"" (ABC, 1985-1992), often found the bumbling title character locked in a control room while attempting to diffuse a ticking time bomb. In 2010, Forte delivered more laughs with a feature film version of ""MacGruber,"" an explosive comedy that proved he was one of the most committed and funniest actors to come out of ""SNL."""

Although Wilde was born in New York City, she was raised in both the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. and in Ireland. Her parents were respected journalists, so Wilde, who was born with the surname Cockburn, grew up in a household that was always booming with the intellectual banter of politicians, writers, and thinkers. When she was in her teens, the then Olivia Cockburn started going by the stage surname of Wilde. This was both to pay homage of the legendary Irish writer Oscar Wilde, as well as to honor the many writers in her family. A standout student, Wilde was accepted to Bard College but deferred enrollment a number of time to pursue an acting career. She eventually went on to study the craft at the Gaeity School of Acting in Dublin. By this time, Wilde held dual citizenships in both the United States and in Ireland. After receiving her formal training, Wilde began nabbing recurring TV roles. She appeared in 6 episodes of the short-lived Fox drama ""Skin"" (Fox, 2003-04), and went on to earn somewhat of a public following for her role as Alex Kelly on the teen drama ""The O.C."" (Fox, 2003-07). By the mid- to late-2000s, Wilde was appearing in a number of films, including ""Alpha Dog"" (2006), ""Year One"" (2009), and ""TRON: Legacy."" In 2007 she also landed her breakout TV role a recurring role on the Fox medical drama ""House."" Wilde played Dr. Remy ""Thirteen"" Hadley on the Golden Globe-winning series from 2007 to 2012. After ""House"" ended in 2012, Wilde continued nabbing parts in films like ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (2013), ""Rush,"" ""The Longest Week"" (2014), and ""Meadowland."" In 2016 she nabbed a part on the highly-anticipated period music drama ""Vinyl"" (HBO, 2016), but HBO cancelled the series after a single season.

A native of Irvine, California, he attended the University of Southern California with an eye towards going into sports broadcasting. After college, however, he joined the Los Angeles improv group The Groundlings. He made his screen debut on the family sitcom ""On Our Own"" (ABC, 1994-95), and added small parts on the hit comedies ""Grace Under Fire"" (ABC, 1993-98) and ""Living Single"" (Fox, 1993-98). Ferrell's big break came in 1995 when he was asked, along with fellow Groundlings member Chris Kattan and Cheri Oteri, to join the cast of ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975-). He initially established himself with characters developed in Los Angeles, including the club-going Butabi Brothers with Kattan, and the overly-enthusiastic Spartan cheerleaders with Oteri. He soon became one of the shows breakout stars, using his impressions of everyone from Alex Trebek to President George W. Bush to tremendous comedic effect. While still on ""SNL,"" he began adding film credits with a cameo in Mike Myers' ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" (1998) and the ""SNL"" sketch based ""A Night at the Roxbury"" (1998). His film profile took a noticeable leap in 2003 when he starred in both Jon Favreau's Christmas-themed film, ""Elf"" (2003) and the broad comedy ""Old School"" (2003), with Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn. Starring in the 1970s parody ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (2004), directed by his longtime writing partner Adam McKay, added another memorable character to his growing portfolio. Wanting to diversify beyond the standard comedy conventions, he added roles in Woody Allen's ""Melinda and Melinda"" (2004), ""Stranger Than Fiction"" (2005), and the musical ""The Producers"" (2005). Soon after, he began one of his most fruitful on-screen pairings when he starred with John C. Reilly in ""Talladega Nights: The Legend of Ricky Bobby"" (2006). The duo would reteam for ""Step Brothers"" (2008). Ferrell and McKay began the online comedy outlet Funny or Die in 2007, featuring a series of short films, including the pair's viral video ""The Landlord"" (2007). He formed yet another film partnership when he worked with Mark Wahlberg on ""The Other Guys"" (2010). They would costar with each other again in ""Daddy's Home"" (2015) and ""Daddy's Home Two"" (2017). While he became recognized as a film star, he didn't shun television. He joined both ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-2013) and ""Eastbound & Down"" (HBO, 2009-13) for multi-episode appearances. Along with McKay, he produced the Emmy-nominated sketch comedy series ""Drunk History"" (Comedy Central, 2011-), and the mini-series ""The Spoils of Babylon"" (IFC, 2014). He was also a much sought after guest on television talk shows, where he would frequently appear in character. Working with fellow ""SNL"" alum Molly Shannon, he starred in the TV film ""The Royal Wedding Live With Cord and Tish!"" (HBO, 2018), and its follow-up ""The 2019 Rose Parade Hosted by Cord & Tish"" (HBO, 2019). Ferrell re-teamed with Reilly for the Sherlock Holmes spoof ""Holmes & Watson"" (2018)."

During this period, he found both solace and inspiration in television comedy, including the broad antics of the Three Stooges, and after stints at both Pennsylvania State University and Temple University, McKay decided to pursue a path in comedy by studying under legendary teacher Del Close at Chicago's Improv Olympic. He later formed his own improv group, the Upright Citizen's Brigade, with such future comedy stars as Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh and Matt Besser. His work with the group - which was marked by a political bent and a decidedly dark streak - led to McKay performing with the main stage group at the famed Second City, and in 1995, a chance to audition for ""Saturday Night Live."" Though he did not make the cut as a performer, producer Lorne Michaels brought him aboard as a writer in 1995, where he met and befriended new cast member Will Ferrell. Together, the pair created some of Ferrell's most memorable creations for the series, including a dim-witted take on then-President George W. Bush; McKay eventually rose to head writer for ""SNL"" before departing in 2001, with Ferrell following suit in 2002. The pair scored a substantial hit with ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" with McKay directing and co-writing and Ferrell starring as an awesomely clueless newscaster; its success begat a string of box office windfalls, including ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" (2006), ""Step Brothers"" (2008) and ""The Other Guys"" (2010), as well as Funny Or Die, a user-submitted comedy video site that generated a slew of popular series, including the long-running ""Drunk History"" (Comedy Central, 2013- ), the irreverent online talk show spoof ""Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifiniakis"" (2008- ), the game show ""Billy on the Street"" (Fuse TV, 2011-15) with Billy Eichner and HBO's ""Funny or Die Presents"" (2010-11). McKay soon became the go-to creative force for broad, absurd comedies on film and television, and lent his talents to a slew of projects ranging from the Ferrell vehicles ""Land of the Lost"" (2009), ""Get Hard"" (2015) and ""Daddy's Home"" (2015) to the HBO series ""Eastbound & Down"" (2009-2013) with Danny McBride and a script rewrite for Marvel's ""Ant-Man"" (2015) with Paul Rudd. In the midst of this flurry of activity, McKay took a turn towards dramatic fare with an adaption of Michael Lewis's non-fiction book ""The Big Short"" (2015), which attempted to explain the 2007-2008 financial crisis caused by the U.S. housing bubble. Its irreverent, biting satire won critical praise and earned McKay and Charles Randolph an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as Oscar nods for Best Picture and Best Director.

After receiving his start in film and on television in his native Australia, Jackman was catapulted to stardom as the edgy, violence-prone Wolverine in the blockbuster hit ""X-Men"" (2000), a role he reprised over the course of his career in sequels like ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009) and ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) before closing the books on his performance in the R-rated finale ""Logan"" (2017). In between, he earned critical acclaim for his performance in the romantic comedy ""Kate & Leopold"" (2001), played a computer-hacking criminal in the thriller ""Swordfish"" (2001) and cut down vampires as ""Van Helsing"" (2004). After starring in Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" (2006) and Darren Aronofsky's ""The Fountain"" (2006), Jackman joined fellow Aussies Nicole Kidman and Baz Luhrmann for the romantic epic ""Australia"" (2008).

Born in Yorkshire, England, he began acting as a youngster, attending the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in his mid-20s, performing with fellow future stars Ben Kingsley and Helen Mirren. He made his screen debut in an episode of ""Story Parade"" (BBC, 1964-65) but primarily concentrated on his stage career until the early-1970s. After gaining notice for his RSC performances in ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Antony and Cleopatra,"" he was cast in the Russian play ""The Love Girl and the Innocent"" for an episode of ""BBC Play of the Month"" (BBC, 1965-83). His stage work crossed over to the screen as well when he recreated his acclaimed portrayal of Enobarbus for ""Antony and Cleopatra"" (ITVC, 1974). On television, he starred in the miniseries ""North & South"" (BBC, 1975) and appeared as Sejanus in ""I, Claudius"" (BBC2, 1976). While still performing regularly on stage, he continued acting occasionally on television, including playing Claudius in a production of ""Hamlet, Prince of Denmark"" (BBC, 1980) and joined the cast of the big screen King Arthur epic ""Excalibur"" (1981). He was cast as the lead in the series ""Maybury"" (BBC2, 1981-83) playing psychiatrist Dr. Edward Roebuck. Stewart also appeared in David Lynch's big-budget adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-novel ""Dune"" (1984). He would soon, though, find a role that would catapult him to lasting fame. After the success of the ""Star Trek"" films of the 1980s, the creator of the original TV series, Gene Roddenberry created a follow-up, ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" with Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise. The show weathered some early bumps to eventually find a rabid and loyal following, thanks in large part to Stewart's commanding performance. It became one of the most successful syndicated shows in television history, winning Hugo and Peabody awards. While appearing on ""Next Generation,"" he continued making stage appearances, including starring in a one-man adaptation of Charles Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" that would become a recurring part of his career. After his series ended, the actor followed the role to the big screen in ""Star Trek Generations"" (1994), getting a chance to appear on screen with his ""Star Trek"" predecessor, William Shatner's James T. Kirk. He showed a markedly different side when he appeared with Steven Weber in the film adaptation of Paul Rudnick's play ""Jeffrey"" (1995) playing a gay decorator whose partner is infected with AIDS. He returned to playing Picard for ""Star Trek: First Contact"" (1996). He went on to star in the comedy ""Masterminds"" (1997) and play Captain Ahab in ""Moby Dick"" (USA Network, 1998). Another return to the Enterprise in ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" (1998) followed, along with a TV version of his stage performance of Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"" (TNT, 1999). As the 21st Century arrived, Stewart found another role that would nearly match Picard. Bryan Singer cast the actor as Professor Charles Xavier, leader of a group of superhero mutants, in ""X-Men"" (2000) based on the popular Marvel comic book. For a time, he was leading two film franchises, appearing in ""Star Trek: Nemesis"" (2002) and ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003). On television, he joined Glenn Close for a retelling of ""The Lion in Winter"" (Showtime, 2003). He also starred with Kyle Machlachlan in Jules Verne's ""Mysterious Island"" (Hallmark, 2005) and in the miniseries ""Eleventh Hour"" (ITV, 2006). He rejoined his mutant cohorts in the sequel ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006). His sonorous vocal style made him a natural for voice work and the actor racked up numerous credits, including lending his talents to shows like ""Family Guy"" (Fox, 1999- ) and ""Robot Chicken"" (Cartoon Network, 2005- ). Stewart returned to his Shakespearian roots with a Tony-nominated turn in ""Macbeth"" and joining David Tennant for ""Hamlet"" (BBC2, 2009). He appeared as well with his ""X-Men"" co-star Ian McKellen in a production of ""Waiting for Godot."" Not everything was quite so highbrow, as the actor starred in the comedy ""Hunting Elephants"" (2013). After starring as a Juilliard dance professor in ""Match"" (2014), he reteamed with McKellen for another mutant adventure. His Professor X and McKellen's Magneto shared the screen with their younger versions, played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender, in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014). The actor also starred in the holiday comedy ""Christmas Eve"" (2015) and the series ""Blunt Talk"" (Starz, 2015-16). He had a chance to play Charles Xavier one more time, starring with Hugh Jackman in ""Logan"" (2017). He starred with Close and John Malkovich in ""The Wilde Wedding"" (2017) and played Merlin in ""The Kid Who Would Be King"" (2019). After appearing in the reboot of ""Charlie's Angels"" (2019).

The daughter of actor Will Keen and actress, theater director, and writer MarÃ­a FernÃ¡ndez Ache, Dafne was also the paternal great-granddaughter of Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe, a member of the English peerage. Known for his roles in ""Victor Frankenstein"" (2015) and ""The Crown"" (Netflix, 2016-), Will Keen acted alongside his daughter in her acting and television debut, ""The Refugees"" (laSexta, 2015). The British-Spanish co-production followed a massive group of refugees time traveling to the past to avoid a deadly virus; both father and daughter were a part of the main cast. Dafne Keen landed her breakout role (and her film debut) as Laura in ""Logan"" (2017), the conclusion of Hugh Jackman's run as the iconic Marvel Comics and X-Men character Wolverine. As his mutant daughter (claws run in the family), Keen received critical praise.

Grant crafted a career that saw him equally at home in projects as disparate as ""Game of Thrones"" (HBO, 2011-) and ""Downton Abbey"" (ITV, 2010-15). Born in Mbabane, Eswatini, he began his acting career in Cape Town, South Africa before relocating to England. After a small role in the sitcom ""Sweet Sixteen"" (BBC, 1983), he quickly jumped into the deep end. Playing the frequently drunk title character in Bruce Robinson's ""Withnail & I"" (1987), Grant was at the center of what would quickly become a cult classic. He teamed again with Robinson for the oddball comedy ""How to Get Ahead in Advertising"" (1989), about a marketing executive with a boil that talks. The work caught Hollywood's attention, and he was soon acting in high-profile fare like ""L.A. Story"" (1991), with Steve Martin, and Robert Altman's ""The Player"" (1992). He also starred in the Academy Award-winning short ""Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life"" (1995). Drawing upon his classical training, he played Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Trevor Nunn's big screen adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night or What You Will"" (1996) opposite Helena Bonham Carter. He found himself exposed to a completely different kind of audience when he joined the pop group Spice Girls in ""Spice World"" (1998). He worked steadily, including playing classic characters such as Bob Cratchit in ""A Christmas Carol"" (TNT, 1999) and the namesake hero in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (BBC, 1999-2000). He began his first brush with the sci-fi classic ""Doctor Who"" (BBC, 2005-) when he appeared with Rowan Atkinson in the comedy short ""Doctor Who - The Curse of Fatal Death"" (BBC, 1999). He went on to voice the Doctor in an animated project ""Doctor Who: Scream of the Shalka"" (BBC, 2003), and then later played the villainous Great Intelligence in the main series. His work in television included recurring roles on ""Downton Abbey"" playing art historian Simon Bricker and as Jasper in ""Girls"" (HBO, 2012-17). He also had a memorable appearance in ""Game of Thrones"" playing the egotistical actor Izembaro. He found a fresh round of acclaim for his talents when he joined Melissa McCarthy for ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" (2018). Playing McCarthy's partner in a scam to sell forged letters from literary greats, Grant earned critical raves and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The stellar notices didn't slow him at all. He continued working, appearing on television in the sitcom ""Hang Ups"" (Channel 4, 2018-) and ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" (Netflix, 2017-19), and in the Disney film ""The Nutcracker and the Four Realms"" (2018). He then carved out a place in yet another sci-fi classic with a starring role in ""Star Wars: Episode IX"" (2019)."

The son of Ellen and Don Holbrook, he was born on September 1, 1981 in the small county seat of Prestonsburg, Kentucky. Holbrook's natural good looks took him to the world of modeling, first signing with Elite Models agency in 2001. He worked with numerous agencies and modeled all over Europe and Asia for designers such as Gucci, Calvin Klein, and Hugo Boss. With the money he saved up from his days as a fashion model, Holbrook studied film at New York University where he earned an SCSP Certificate in 16mm film. Ambition turned to good fortune for Holbrook in 2007 when he sent an original screenplay to director Gus Van Sant. Impressed by his work, Van Sant cast him in his movie ""Milk,"" a biographical film about the late gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk. The film was a critical success and won Best Original Screenplay at the 2009 Academy Awards. Holbrook next had the opportunity to work with both Academy Award-winner Kevin Costner and Golden Globe nominee Bill Paxton in the History Channel's three-part television miniseries ""Hatfields & McCoys"" (2012).

Success from the series led to more work with Gervais on another popular radio show, acting and writing jobs on other BBC programs, and the smash-hit adaptation of ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-13) on American TV. In addition to his usual duties, Merchant also performed in his and Gervais' next series, ""Extras"" (HBO, BBC2, 2005-07). His performance as the well-meaning, but utterly incompetent talent agent Darren Lamb earned Merchant a British Comedy Award for Best Actor.

Astonishingly prolific, he had amassed a career's worth of credits in a scant 10 years, and along with Gervais, earned the respect and adoration of fans, both famous and not, for their consistently hilarious work together as a comedic team."

Before long, however, he eventually gravitated towards acting and was soon attending an acting workshop for teenagers in Ohio. It was there that Fouse was discovered by a talent manager, who quickly signed him, but with one caveat: the manager wanted Fouse to move to L.A. With just a few months left until he was set to graduate from high school, Fouse made the wise decision of postponing his big move to Hollywood and instead decided to finish his schooling.

Although the film was considered a box office disappointment, Kinberg got back on track the same year thanks to the success of Doug Liman's sprightly romcom thriller ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" in which Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play a sedate suburban married couple who both, unbeknownst to the other, are hired assassins. Subsequently, Kinberg penned further high-profile films including 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (the conclusion of the hugely successful ""X-Men"" trilogy), and 2008's supernatural teen thriller ""Jumper,"" on which he was reunited with Liman. In 2009, Kinberg scripted Guy Ritchie's high-octane revisionist take on ""Sherlock Holmes,"" starring Robert Downey Jr. as the legendary sleuth, and returned to romcom thriller territory in 2012 by penning McG's love triangle flick ""This Means War,"" starring Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy and Chris Pine."

Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Shuler fell in love with movies at a very young age. She would often sneak off to the theater with her cousin to see the newest release. Growing up in the Midwest was like being a million miles away from Hollywood. But even as a little girl, Shuler had big dreams of making movies one day. Thus, when it came time to enter college, Shuler attended Boston University, where she studied film production and editing. After college Shuler moved to Los Angeles to launch her film career. She quickly made a name for herself as an editor, and later as a camera operator for sitcoms, the latter of which was a field largely dominated by men in the 1970s. However, Shuler longed to be producing movies - she just needed a way in. Her opportunity came in 1978 when, after giving some creative advice on the script, she was credited as an associate producer on the 1978 disco comedy ""Thank God It's Friday."" Her work on the film opened up a numerous doors for Shuler, and in 1983 she produced her first feature film ""Mr. Mom"" (1983), which was successful at the box office. Shuler would go on to produce several more successful films throughout the 80s and 90s, including ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986), ""Free Willy"" (1993), ""Bulworth"" (1998), and the romantic comedy ""You've Got Mail"" (1998). Then in 2000 Shuler, along with her husband, director Richard Donner, produced the big screen adaptation of the popular comic book ""X-Men"" (2000). The film was a huge success at the international box office, and spawned numerous X-Men sequels and spin-offs, including 2017's ""Logan,"" to become one of the most successful franchises in movie history. In addition to movies, Shuler also produced the television shows ""The Gifted"" (Fox, 2017- ) and ""Legion"" (Fox, 2017- ), both of which premiered in 2017."

Warehoused as a Universal acquisition and underutilized at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the lanky, dark-eyed actress tested her comic chops in George Cukor's ""The Women"" (1939) before coming into her own as Cary Grant's co-star in Howard Hawks' ""His Girl Friday"" (1940) - a role refused by almost every A-list actress in Hollywood. Tailoring the script to the talents of his stars, whom he encouraged to ad lib for the camera, Hawks delivered the rare Hollywood hit to please critics and audiences alike, while Russell made of her brassy distaff journalist Hildy Johnson a role model for American women braving the male-dominated workforce. Russell also found satisfaction on stage, winning a Tony for ""Wonderful Town"" in 1953 and reprising her 1956 Broadway success as ""Auntie Mame"" in Warner Brothers' lavish Technicolor film adaptation. The four-time Academy Award nominee transitioned deftly to middle-age, playing a small town spinster in ""Picnic"" (1955) and mentoring Natalie Wood's budding burlesque star in ""Gypsy"" (1962). Diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, Russell threw herself into charity work, for which she received the 1973 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award only a few years before breast cancer robbed Hollywood of one of its most unique talents, a glamorous leading lady with the soul of a vaudevillian."

While he was a gentle-mannered, church-going man in real life, Hall did very well for himself with his bad-guy image, aided in no small part by his bug-eyes and cold exterior. He originally mastered his acting chops on the theater stage, but it wasn't long before Hall made his way to the bright lights of Hollywood, debuting on-screen with two uncredited 1931 roles in the George Abbott-directed dramas ""Secrets of a Secretary"" and ""The Cheat."" He eventually graduated to side roles in films like the 1936 Cecile B. DeMille western, ""The Plainsman,"" but Hall truly broke out in the late '30s, particularly with a role as Senator Martin Monroe in the 1939 James Stewart-starring courtroom drama, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" Though Hall always found work playing side characters, never fully moving to leading man status, he became a reliable character presence throughout the 1940s and 1950s, popping up in many high-profile pictures, including the 1940 Howard Hawks screwball comedy, ""His Girl Friday,"" the 1944 Billy Wilder film noir, ""Double Indemnity,"" and George Seaton's 1947 Christmas feel-good film, ""Miracle on 34th Street."""

He specialized in Scandinavians, but actually played various nationalities over the course of his career, which caught its first break in 1929 when he portrayed Carl Olsen, a Swedish janitor in the Broadway play ""Street Scene."" He recreated the part for a film version two years later, the first of a long line of different movies and accents. The same year as ""Street Scene,"" he was in John Ford's ""Arrowsmith,"" which started a lengthy collaboration with the director. For over 30 years, he belonged to Ford's stock company and appeared in some of his best-known films, often playing working-class men with ethnic names--Lars Jorgensen in ""The Searchers,"" Axel Swanson in ""The Long Voyage Home,"" Ericson in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""--and enunciations to go with them. His characters' accents were sometimes intended for humorous effect; exceptions included Ford's 1940 adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" in which Qualen played the irrevocably broken Muley Graves. With a Midwestern twang, Graves told the story of farms being foreclosed and homes being destroyed. That unexpectedly haunting accent found its way into a comedy, too--Howard Hawks's 1940 ""His Girl Friday,"" in which Qualen portrayed a convicted murderer. Another role he is widely remembered for is Victor Laszlo's Resistance contact, Berger, in ""Casablanca,"" whose Scandinavian accent fit the cosmopolitan setting perfectly."

Born in 1894 to a pair of opera singers, Gilbert began working on stage when he was just a boy. He soon became known for a unique ability: being able to sneeze on cue. Pudgy as an adult, Gilbert's size made him perfect as the imposing and bumbling villain of 1930s comedy shorts. In 1937 Gilbert brought his childhood talent to the animated classic ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" as the voice (and ""achoo"") of dwarf Sneezy. Into the 1940s, Gilbert was occupied with small parts in comedies, including turns in the screwball ""His Girl Friday,"" the musical ""Anchors Aweigh,"" and the Fred MacMurray vehicle ""One Night in Lisbon."" However his biggest role of the period, and perhaps of his career, was as Herring (a thinly veiled portrait of Nazi war minister Hermann GÃ¶ring) in Chaplin's Third Reich satire ""The Great Dictator.""

After receiving his start in silent movies, Hawks worked in nearly every film genre imaginable, and collaborated with the greatest acting and writing talent of the day. ""Scarface"" (1932), scripted by Ben Hecht, set the standard for the gangster film, while the Cary Grant vehicles ""Bringing Up Baby"" (1938) and ""His Girl Friday"" (1940), as well as the Carole Lombard classic ""Twentieth Century"" (1934) became three of the most often imitated screwball comedies of all time. The wartime biopic ""Sergeant York"" (1941) earned Gary Cooper an Oscar and the drama ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944) introduced the world to the onscreen combo of Bogie and Bacall. Hawks worked with the likes of literary legend William Faulkner on the film noir ""The Big Sleep"" (1946) and forever altered the genre of science fiction with his terrifying production of ""The Thing from Another World"" (1951). The director boosted the careers of such screen icons as Marilyn Monroe in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" (1953) and reunited time and again with favored screenwriter Leigh Brackett on projects like the influential John Wayne Western ""Rio Bravo"" (1959). Telling his stories in a deceptively straightforward manner that belied the subtle artistry of his work, Hawks produced rousing adventures in which men were bound together by adversity, and raucous comedies, wherein the male's orderly world was hilariously undone by the free-spirited, sharp-tongued woman. Finally acknowledged for his contributions to film with an honorary Academy Award late in life, Hawks was more importantly recognized as a master craftsman by such auteur directors as Peter Bogdanovich, Brian de Palma and John Carpenter, whose admiration of Hawks exposed new generations to the varied works of the long undervalued filmmaker."

He went on to pen several successful Broadway plays, including ""The Front Page,"" one of the most widely staged productions of its era, and a number of acclaimed books, including both fiction, non-fiction and anthologies. Hollywood took notice and Hecht was soon putting his skills to work for the silver screen. Within a year, he had won an Academy Award for ""Underworld"" (1927) and a litany of his credits from that point onward was staggering. Some of the finest movies produced from the 1930s through the early 1960s Hecht either wrote the screenplay or was brought in for an uncredited polish. Some of his greatest works included Scarface"" (1932), ""Nothing Sacred"" (1937), ""A Star is Born"" (1937), ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Gone With the Wind"" (1939), ""Foreign Correspondent"" (1940), ""Tales of Manhattan"" (1942), ""The Black Swan"" (1942), ""Spellbound"" (1945), ""Notorious"" (1946), ""Kiss of Death"" (1947), ""Strangers on a Train"" (1951) and ""Guys and Dolls"" (1955). His ability to turn out high-quality work in a short period of time - sometimes as little as two weeks - on such a wide variety of genres kept Hecht in near constant demand, and while he considered movies to be a lesser art form, Hecht's creativity and talent for intelligent plotting and crackling dialogue was indisputable."

Like Hecht, the droll, larger-than-life MacArthur earned his literary stripes in the highly competitive world of 1920s Chicago, where dozens of reporters would vie for headlines and only the most creative and talented would rise to the top. MacArthur thrived in this environment and later used his talents to pen Broadway plays, including the highly successful comedy ""The Front Page"" (1928-29), his first and finest collaboration with Hecht, and the madcap ""Twentieth Century"" which was adapted into one of the finest screwball comedies of all time in 1934. MacArthur further cemented his fame with the New York high society crowd when he married beloved Broadway star Helen Hayes, the First Lady of the American Theater. Working with Hecht, MacArthur earned an Academy Award and a pair of nominations for writing such notable movies as ""Rasputin and the Empress"" (1932), ""The Scoundrel"" (1935), ""Gunga Din"" (1939) and ""Wuthering Heights"" (1939). The pair also directed a handful of features and MacArthur found himself in demand as a script doctor, doing anonymous re-writes on such films as ""The Sin of Madelon Claudet"" (1931) and ""Freaks"" (1932). Prolific and consistently witty, MacArthur brought considerable verve and intelligence to his work and those qualities were perfectly showcased in ""The Front Page,"" one of the most enduring and re-staged American plays of any era."

The independent drama dealt with a team of teenage girls on a synchronized swimming team whose developing sexualy creates confusion, elation, and fear. Sciamma, a graduate of Paris' prestigious Le Femis screenwriting program, was intensely interested in the fluidity of sexuality, as well as the unique perspective of youth, infusing these ideas into ""Water Lilies,"" which was chosen for screening in the Un certain regard section at the Cannes Film Festival, and went on to be nominated for three Cesar Awards. The filmmaker's next move was directing a short film for the French government's anti-homophobia campaign called ""Pauline"" (2009). Soon, Sciamma was moving on to further explore similar themes in her next feature film ""Tomboy"" (2011), following the story of a nine-year-old girl who chooses to begin living her life as a boy. The film's uniquely sparse directorial style, insight into gender identity, and incisive depiction of childhood earned Sciamma comparisons to greats like Francois Truffaut. Sciamma wasted no time developing her next feature, ""Girlhood"" (2014), a film inspired by the groups of teenage girls she would often see loitering in public places around Paris like the Metro station or the the Les Halles shopping centre, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2015."

Though he could have gone Hollywood and become a big celebrity, Bernal chose instead to star in films he was passionate about. Always with his finger on the pulse of social and political issues, he delivered an exquisite performance as a young Che Guevara, who undergoes a transformation while on a road trip, in ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" (2004). He continued making interesting choices, taking such off-the-wall roles as a drag queen in ""Bad Education"" (2004) and a shy daydreamer in ""The Science of Sleep"" (2006).

Starting as a film actor in the 1950s and breaking into television in revolutionary Cuba in the early 1960s, Arau re-immersed himself in the cinema of his native land in the 1970s, collaborating with Mexican film greats Alberto Isaac and Alejandro Jodorowsky and taking up the auteur mantle himself with the comedy ""El Ã¡guila descalza"" (1971). He drew greater acclaim for the 1974 subversive comedy ""Inspector Calzonzin."" The 1980s saw him don some memorable comedic supporting roles in U.S. films, notably an amiable jefe of a drug gang in ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984) and a hyperbolic desperado in ""Three Amigos!""

The success garnered him work in the U.S. helming the period romance ""A Walk in the Clouds"" (1995), the oddball ensemble comedy ""Picking Up the Pieces"" (2000) and the ambitious TV miniseries remake of the ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (A&E, 2002).

Born Feb. 1, 1994 in Evesham, England, U.K., Harold Edward ""Harry"" Styles grew up idolizing Elvis Presley and The Beatles. He was the lead singer for a local band, White Eskimo, which enjoyed some minor hometown success. Determined to make it as a singer, he auditioned as a solo act for ""The X Factor"" (ITV, 2004- ) in 2010, performing Stevie Wonder's hit single ""Isn't She Lovely."" Sent for additional training at the show's musical boot camp by the judges, Styles's rendition of ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" was deemed not strong enough for him to make the cut as a solo singer. Happily, this opened other professional doors for Styles, who was teamed with fellow contestants Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson to form One Direction, whose name was coined by Styles himself. As a boy band, they placed third on ""The X Factor"" and ascended to international superstardom with the 2011 release of their debut single, ""What Makes You Beautiful."" Hitting number one on the U.K. singles chart and breaking sales records, the song paved the way for a follow-up hit, ""Gotta Be You,"" and their global smash debut album, Up All Night. Continuing their meteoric rise, the band notched a sold-out U.K. tour and won three 4Music Awards (Best Group, Breakthrough and Video), a Brit Award (Best British Single for ""What Makes You Beautiful"") and two U.K. Kids' Choice Awards (Favorite U.K. Newcomer and Favorite Band). Their European success led to their American breakthrough, with their album hitting No. 1 and One Direction replicating their European success in the States with a flood of endorsements, publicity appearances and television performances. They were featured as the musical guest (and appeared in a skit) on the Sofia Vergara-hosted episode of ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ), booked a guest spot on ""iCarly"" (Nickelodeon, 2007- ), and announced plans for a 2012 world tour. Unlike the previous wave of boy bands, One Direction eschewed matching clothing and tightly choreographed dancing, radiating instead a seemingly less manufactured, less polished image. Although much of One Direction's appeal came from their unified front of playful energy, each member stood out in his own way. Styles' charm came from his artfully shaggy hair, winning personality and endearing quirks, including a brief relationship with the much older Caroline Flack and his love of being naked. Especially close to bandmate and roommate Louis Tomlinson, the twosome were jointly referred to affectionately as ""Larry Stylinson"" by fans. Three further hit albums followed before One Direction announced that the group was taking an indefinite hiatus in 2016. Styles began his solo career with a self-titled album in early 2017. Taking on a new musical direction that harkened back to vintage '70s pop artists like Elton John and Paul McCartney, Harry Styles enjoyed critical respect from many who had dismissed One Direction, and went to Number One in charts across the globe. That same year, Style made his film debut in Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"" (2017), garnering solid reviews as a British army private in the midst of one of the defining battles of World War II. Writer/director Nolan claimed to be unaware of Styles' fame as a pop star when he cast the young actor for the role."

Born into a working class family in Mid Glamorgan, Wales, Barnard's first brush with professional acting came when he was 11 years old. He was cast as Young Jonathan on Welsh TV series ""Jacob's Ladder"" (HTV Wales, 2003-04), and instantly fell in love. Although his role on the series was minor, Barnard decided to pursue his love of performance by enrolling in the acting program at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. While studying at the college, Barnard developed a love for theater, and before long was appearing in popular musicals like ""Spring Awakening"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" on the London stage, as well as in theaters across his native Wales. With his stage acting career already on the rise, Barnard nabbed his first major film role in the 2011 historical action drama ""Ironclad."" The film also starred Paul Giamatti and Kate Mara. Barnard continued appearing primarily in film roles over the next few years, most notably ""Hunky Dory"" (2011), ""Citadel"" (2012), and ""Mary Queen of Scots"" (2013). In 2013 Barnard played King Richard III on the BBC miniseries ""The White Queen"" (BBC, 2013), which was also broadcast in the United States on the Starz network. Barnard returned to the miniseries format three years later with roles in ""War & Peace"" (History, 2016) and ""Thirteen"" (BBC, 2016), thus further establishing himself as a talented young actor on the rise. Then in 2017 Barnard nabbed his breakout role in the Christopher Nolan-directed World War II epic ""Dunkirk."""

(2011) or portraying an iconic actor who essayed one of the most demented characters in cinematic history, as he did in the biopic Hitchcock"" (2012). The classically trained D'Arcy launched his career with a string of appearances in British TV movies and historical miniseries like ""Silent Witness"" (BBC, 1996) and ""Rebel Heart"" (BBC, 2001), followed by lead parts in made-for-TV films like Sherlock: Case of Evil"" (USA Network, 2002). Playing against type, D'Arcy appeared in many horror films like ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" (2004) and ""An American Haunting"" (2005), and delivered a spine-tingling performance in the 2012 thriller ""In Their Skin,"" as a homicidal maniac who keeps a family hostage in their own home. That same year, D'Arcy stepped into the role of Anthony Perkins in the biopic ""Hitchcock,"" bringing to light all of the late actor's nervous idiosyncrasies and unequaled onscreen talent. Further roles in the British crime drama ""Broadchurch"" (ITV 2013- ) and Marvel's 1940s-set ""Agent Carter"" (ABC 2015-16), as well as his co-starring role in Christopher Nolan's powerful war film ""Dunkirk"" (2017), helped prove that D'Arcy was one of Hollywood's fastest rising stars with unlimited emotional range. James D' Arcy was born on Aug. 24, 1975 in London, England, where he also attended school at Christ's Hospital. He discovered his passion for acting around 1991, when he traveled to Australia for a year to work in the drama department of a school in Perth. Upon his return to London, D'Arcy enrolled at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, where he earned a bachelors degree in 1995. During his three-year course at LAMDA, D'Arcy honed his acting skills by appearing in various plays like ""Heracles,"" ""As You Like It,"" and ""Sherlock Holmes,"" among many others. He began his transition from stage to screen actor with appearances on popular crime dramas such as ""Silent Witness"" and ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" (BBC, 1996-2007), followed by minor roles in TV movies like ""The Ice House"" (BBC, 1997), about a decades-long murder investigation involving three lonely women. D'Arcy continued to pad his rÃ©sumÃ© with a featured role in the war drama ""The Trench"" (1999), where he played one of the more cynical and educated soldiers of the group, who are stationed in the Western Front trenches 48 hours before the historic Battle of the Somme. In 2001, D'Arcy started landing meatier roles including a lead part on the BBC miniseries ""Rebel Heart,"" a story about a fictional Irish nationalist and his exploits during the Irish War of Independence from 1916 until the end of the Civil War. He played a young Sherlock Holmes in the made-for-TV film ""Sherlock: Case of Evil,"" receiving mostly positive reviews for his convincing portrayal of the world's most famous sleuth. D'Arcy continued to make inroads across the pond by landing more high-profile roles in films like ""The Far Side of the World"" (2003) opposite Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. Aside from historical and crime dramas, D'Arcy also carved out a niche in the horror film genre with roles in ""Exorcist: The Beginning"" and ""An American Haunting,"" starring in the latter as a 19th century professor who becomes involved with a young woman who sees apparitions. D'Arcy went on to appear in a string of British TV miniseries like ""Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire"" (BBC, 2006), as the 2nd century Roman politician Tiberius Gracchu, and ""Mansfield Park"" (iTV, 2007), based on Jane Austen's 1814 novel of the same name. In the telefilm, D'Arcy portrayed Thomas Bertram, the eldest son of a wealthy landowner who is only concerned about spending his father's money and living off the family's estate. D'Arcy had a recurring part on the British dramedy series ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"" (iTV, 2007-2011), about a high-class London prostitute (Billie Piper) who is trying to juggle the demands of her professional and personal life. D'Arcy further boosted his career after scoring the lead role in Madonna's second directorial effort, the 2010 historical romance drama ""W.E.,"" which follows two love stories between two women separated by more than six decades. D'Arcy portrayed the dashing and suave British monarch King Edward VII, who was forced to abdicate the throne to marry American divorcÃ©e Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough) in the 1930s. In 2012, D'Arcy made waves by starring in several critically acclaimed films, including the Wachowski brothers' ""Cloud Atlas,"" a sci-fi drama of six interwoven stories taking place from the 19th century all the way to a post-apocalyptic future, and featuring Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. D'Arcy also delivered a chilling performance in the indie thriller ""In Their Skin,"" as a psychopath who terrorizes a grief-stricken couple (Selma Blair and Joshua Close) as they vacation in their secluded country home. His most buzzed-about role came as real-life actor Anthony Perkins in the 2012 biopic ""Hitchcock,"" about the love story between the iconic filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren) during the filming of his horror classic ""Psycho"" (1960). D'Arcy's portrayal of Perkins in the highly anticipated film was well-received, with many critics describing him as ""physically right"" for the role, and that he brought to life Perkins' eerie body language, voice and emotional range. D'Arcy moved to television with a key role in British crime drama ""Broadchurch"" (ITV 2013-17), while appearing in films ranging from the broad comedy ""Let's Be Cops"" (2014) to Lana and Andy Wachowski's space opera ""Jupiter Ascending"" (2015) to the crime thriller ""Survivor"" (2015). His introduction to American TV audiences came with his role as Edwin Jarvis in Marvel's 1940s-set superhero series ""Agent Carter"" (ABC 2015-16). He next co-starred in Christopher Nolan's gripping war drama ""Dunkirk"" (2017), restaging one of the most decisive European battles of World War II."

Born on October 17, 1992 in Dublin, Ireland, Keoghan began acting in earnest in 2011, with appearances on the soap opera ""Fair City"" (RTE One, 1989-) and the short film ""Stand Up"" (2011). In 2013, Keoghan landed another part on a popular TV drama, playing Wayne, the ""heartless cat killer"" on ""Love/Hate"" (RTE, 2010-2014), before making his film breakthrough in Rebecca Daly's drama ""Mammal"" (2016), for which he received a nomination for Best Actor in a Lead Role - Film at the Irish Film and Television Awards. However, 2017 would prove to be Keoghan's biggest year yet, with important roles in two highly popular and well-regarded films: Christopher Nolan's WWII drama ""Dunkirk"" (2017), alongside Mark Rylance and Cillian Murphy, and Yorgos Lanthimos's revenge horror ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017), with Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman."

After his directorial breakthrough with his interpretation of The Bard's ""Henry V"" (1989), Branagh had what appeared to many to be the picture-perfect life: a beautiful wife in Emma Thompson, a thriving career - thanks to his deft thriller ""Dead Again"" (1991) - and a reputation replete with an air of seriousness and unerring artistic credibility. But on the inside, Branagh claimed to have been going a bit mad, a realization exacerbated by his separation from Thompson and the debacle of ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1995). Later in life, he learned how to relax every now and then, but continued to push himself to greater artistic heights, sometimes to the point of failure, as with ""Hamlet"" (1996) and ""Love's Labour's Lost"" (2000). He rebounded, however, with a marvelous performance as a young Franklin Delano Roosevelt in ""Warm Springs"" (HBO, 2005), followed by an acclaimed turn as a brilliant but dysfunctional detective in the ""Wallander"" (PBS, 2009) miniseries and a return to the director's chair for the superhero smash ""Thor"" (2011), live-action fantasy ""Cinderella"" (2015) and cozy murder mystery ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017). With his heralded body of work as an actor, writer and director, Branagh had long emerged from Olivier's shadow to be recognized as one of the more formidable filmmakers of his generation."

He eventually landed his first film roles, mainly in British-made independents, before finally achieving international stardom with director Danny Boyle's post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, ""28 Days Later"" (2002), which soon opened the doors to Hollywood. Following a small role in the Oscar-nominated ""Cold Mountain"" (2003), Murphy proved an able villain as the menacing Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" (2005) and a terrifying flight companion in the thriller ""Red Eye"" (2005). Though he drifted back into more independent-minded movies like Neil Jordan's ""Breakfast on Pluto"" (2005), Boyle's small-scale sci-fi adventure ""Sunshine"" (2007) and Sally Potter's comedy ""The Party"" (2017), Murphy was equally comfortable appearing in high-profile Hollywood films like Ron Howard's whaling drama ""In the Heart of the Sea"" (2015) and Nolan's World War II drama ""Dunkirk"" (2017)."

He moved with his parents to the United States at the age of 2, eventually settling in Wisconsin, where his father accepted a teaching position at a college in Milwaukee. Rylance would spend the remainder of his formative years in the United States, before returning to England at 18 to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Rylance studied acting for two years at the school, before embarking on a full-time stage-acting career in 1980. Rylance appeared in plays all across London, while developing a name for himself as an important young theater actor. In 1985 he started taking on roles in films as well, with appearances in ""Wallenberg: A Hero's Story"" (1985), ""Hearts of Fire"" (1987), and ""Prospero's Books"" (1991). His burgeoning career as a movie actor may have been taking off, but through his incredibly productive period during the '80s and '90s Rylance never gave up on his theater work. He appeared in dozens of plays during this period, and in 1995 became the very first Artistic Director of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London. Rylance would retain his role as Artistic Director for the next 10 years, all while continuing to appear in film and television roles. As a screen actor, 2015 proved to by Rylance's biggest year to date. In addition to appearing as Thomas Cromwell in the mini-series ""Wolf Hall"" (BBC Two, 2015), he also nabbed a supporting part in Steven Spielberg's historical thriller ""Bridge of Spies"" (2015), which earned him an Academy Award. Rylance's CGI-enhanced performance in Spielberg's Roald Dahl fantasy adaptation ""The BFG"" (2016) was less well-received both critically and commercially, though the two reteamed yet again for the science fiction action film ""Ready Player One"" (2018).

Though he made his feature debut with the ultra-low budget indie, ""Following"" (1998), Nolan put himself on the map with ""Memento"" (2000), a classic revenge story with the unique twist of being told backwards. Hailed by many critics and - by indie standards - made successful by a rabid audience, ""Memento"" quickly turned Nolan's fortunes, establishing him as a highly sought-after talent. He soon followed with the thriller ""Insomnia"" (2002), starring heavy-hitters Al Pacino, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams. But it was the blockbuster ""Batman Begins"" (2005) - a reimagined take on a long-defunct film franchise - that propelled Nolan to the upper tier of Hollywood directors. His dark, brooding take on the avenging crusader was much more aligned with its original intention than any other subsequent incarnation had been, earning critical praise, audience admiration and a large chunk of box office dollars. With ""The Prestige"" (2006), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) and ""Inception"" (2010), his reputation as an auteur working in a blockbuster world was firmly cemented. Later works ""Interstellar"" (2014) and ""Dunkirk"" (2017) showed that his mastery of form extended to philosophical science fiction and gripping war drama as well."

Having quickly moved up the ranks, Zimmer became a go-to favorite for directors looking to add something different to the more standardized compositions offered by more classically trained composers. He reached the pinnacle of his career when he wrote the African-inspired rhythms for the hit animated feature, ""The Lion King"" (1994); the music from which long remained a signature for his unique stylings. From there, Zimmer seemed to be nominated for some major award or another every year, thanks to writing such memorable music for the films ""Gladiator"" (2000), ""The Last Samurai"" (2003) and ""The Dark Knight"" (2008).

Despite the enormity of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy and its place in cinema history, Hamill's later film career faltered, only for him to reemerge to breathe life into various animated characters. Because ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas spun the films off into comic books, animated series and video games, Hamill was assured work reprising Skywalker for years, long before J.J.

With a Danish pastry hairdo and white robes, Fisher's Leia endeared herself to generations of obsessive fans who flocked to the sequels ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983). She tried to escape the role with memorable turns in ""The Blues Brothers"" (1980) and ""When Harry Met Sally"" (1989), but was unable to break free. Meanwhile, Fisher secretly struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, as well as bipolar disorder, which she first revealed with the semi-autobiographical novel Postcards from the Edge (1987), which was adapted into a 1990 film starring Meryl Streep. Equally discordant were her romantic affairs, which included a brief dalliance with Dan Aykroyd and a longtime relationship with singer Paul Simon, whom she married in 1983. In 2006, the self-deprecating Fisher took to the stage to poke fun at her addictions in the one-woman show, ""Wishful Drinking.""

Boyega was born on March 17, 1992 in London, England to Nigerian parents. He was interested in performing from a young age, participating in school plays and taking theater classes. He attended South Thames College, where he was a performing arts major and played the titular role in ""Othello."" He went on to take classes at the Identity Drama School, where he was cast in many stage productions. His first television role was as a bully in the supernatural and short-lived ""Being Human"" (BBC 2008-2013) spinoff ""Becoming Human"" (BBC 2011). He then took on a lead role in the sci-fi comedy movie ""Attack the Block."" Boyega played Moses, a gang leader facing an alien invasion, a role that won Boyega multiple nominations for best breakthrough performance in England. He went on to star in the film adaptation of popular Nigerian-American author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" (2013). In April 2014, it was revealed that Boyega would star as Finn the stormtrooper in J.J. Abrams' ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015). This decision made Boyega the recipient of some racist internet bullying, but he responded by posting a message on Instagram telling those who thought there couldn't be a black stormtrooper to ""get used to it."""
987,Oscar Isaac,3/9/1979,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",https://resizing.flixster.com/l0cpHnBjWmta6-pFLP_aFrUEKI0=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/493617_v9_bc.jpg,"After graduating from Juilliard in 2005, Oscar Isaac embarked on a whirlwind acting career, working with some of the industry's biggest stars and directors. In 2011 alone, Isaac starred alongside Channing Tatum in ""10 Years"" and Ryan Gosling in ""Drive,"" and worked with Madonna on the historical drama ""W.E."" Soon, he became a leading man in critically-acclaimed films like ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (2013) and ""A Most Violent Year"" (2014) before leaping into the commercial mainstream via his performance as cocky pilot Poe Dameron in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015) and a key role in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016). A versatile actor in his own right, Isaac was known for immersing himself in each performance, whether it be an ex-con, musician or historical figure, and quickly rose to become one of Hollywood's hottest young character actors. Born in Guatemala, Oscar Isaac moved with his family to the United States when he was four months old. His family moved often in his youth, briefly residing in Baltimore and St. Louis, before finally settling in Miami, FL. It was there that Isaac first discovered his love of acting. He acted in several local plays throughout the city, before making his way to New York. While staying in New York, Isaac applied to the prestigious Juilliard School of Drama. Although he had limited experience at the time of his application, Isaac was accepted into the school, thus beginning his professional training as an actor. After graduation, Isaac landed a part as a Russian mobster in director Scott Z. Burns' 2006 drama, ""Pu-239."" Isaac's performance caught the attention of Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh, who cast Isaac as an interpreter in his next film, the underseen biopic ""Che"" (2008). Although his part in Soderbergh's epic two-part historical drama was small, Isaac soon began landing larger roles in major Hollywood movies. He played Prince John in 2010's ""Robin Hood,"" a star musician that returns home for his high school reunion in ""10 Years,"" and a troubled ex-convict in the critically acclaimed crime drama ""Drive."" In 2012, Isaac appeared alongside Academy Award-winner Holly Hunter in the school drama ""Won't Back Down."" However, despite an all-star cast that also included Viola Davis and Maggie Gyllenhaal, the film received generally poor reviews upon its release. That year, Isaac was also featured as a secret operative in ""The Bourne Legacy,"" starring Jeremy Renner. Isaac's major breakthrough arrived in 2013, when he portrayed the folk-singing title character in Joel and Ethan Coen's 1960s-set film ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" The movie featured an impressive supporting cast, including fellow ""Drive"" actor Carey Mulligan, and pop star Justin Timberlake. Isaac opted for another ensemble production with ""Therese"" (2013) (also known as ""In Secret""), a moody literary adaptation co-starring Elizabeth Olsen and Jessica Lange. After co-starring opposite Viggo Mortensen in the Patricia Highsmith adaptation ""The Two Faces of January"" (2014), Isaac starred in J.C. Chandor's crime drama ""A Most Violent Year"" (2014), garnering widespread praise for his portrayal of a compromised businessman in early '80s New York. The science fiction love story ""Ex Machina"" (2015) and indie thriller ""Mojave"" (2015) followed, along with David Simon and Paul Haggis' miniseries ""Show Me A Hero"" (HBO 2015), for which Isaac won a Golden Globe for his starring role as a city council member running for mayor of Yonkers during a 1980s public housing crisis. Isaac reached an even broader audience with his crowd-pleasing turn as cocky pilot Poe Dameron in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), which he reprised in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017). In between, he starred in the villainous title role of ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016) and co-starred in a historical romance set against the Armenian genocide in ""The Promise"" (2016). Isaac next appeared in the crime comedy ""Suburbicon"" (2017), written by Joel and Ethan Coen and directed by George Clooney before reteaming with ""Ex Machina"" director Alex Garland for ""Annihilation"" (2018), which also starred Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh."

Though he initially resisted becoming an actor, early appearances in two U.K. miniseries, ""Rebel Heart"" (BBC, 2001) and ""The Last Furlong"" (RTE, 2005), eventually gave way to roles in plays such as David Mamet's ""American Buffalo"" and Martin McDonagh's ""The Lieutenant of Inishmore."" Projects like his 2009 self-written directorial debut, the short film ""What Will Survive Us,"" and his stint as a writer and performer on the Irish sketch-comedy series ""Your Bad Self"" (RTE, 2010) fueled Gleeson's creativity, while his role as Bill Weasley in the epic ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" (2010) and ""Part 2"" (2011), along with memorable performances in ""Never Let Me Go"" (2010) and ""True Grit"" (2010), provided international exposure. After a strong 2012 that found him in both ""Shadow Dancer"" and ""Anna Karenina,"" it seemed like the once-reluctant Domhnall Gleeson finally became comfortable with being an actor. That quickly led to a string of even higher-profile roles, including a starring role in science fiction love story ""Ex Machina"" (2015) and the period drama ""Brooklyn"" (2015), as well as key supporting roles in Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu's ""The Revenant"" (2015), Darren Aronofsky's ""mother!""

Emerging as a dramatic radio performer with the BBC, and later, as a Shakespearean stage actor at London's Young Vic Theatre, Daniels initially scoffed at the offer to play a robot in a low-budget, sci-fi adventure from the mind of a relatively unknown director. However, the unprecedented success of ""Star Wars"" surely made the thespian thankful he reconsidered, especially in light of the continued appeal of the film's sequels, ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" (1983), in both of which his character figured prominently. Over the years that immediately followed, Daniels enjoyed the ancillary opportunities provided by the success of ""Star Wars,"" in addition to landing the rare non-""Threepio"" role. Work as a theme park attraction consultant, journalist, and fiction writer preceded his return as C-3PO in the highly-anticipated prequels, culminating in ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005). Seemingly consigned to portray the beloved ""droid"" for the remainder of his career in varying mediums that included animated series and video games, the good-natured and grateful Daniels wisely chose to embrace, rather than lament his eternal connection to C-3PO. His appearance onscreen in the franchise reboot ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015) drew cheers from audiences around the world."

Once Gwendoline Christie came aboard in the role of Brienne of Tarth, her career took off, leading to featured appearances in ""The Hunger Games"" films as well as the ultimate fanboy franchise, the resurrection of the ""Star Wars"" universe. Christie was born in 1978 in Worthing, West Sussex, and grew up near South Downs. Christie grew very tall, 6'3, and was going to be a gymnast, but after injuring her back she turned to acting instead. Christie graduated from Drama Centre London in 2005, and was mentored by Simon Callow, a British actor and author who had featured roles in ""Amadeus"" (1984) and ""Shakespeare In Love"" (1998). In the British acting tradition, Christie performed in the theater, playing the Queen in Shakespeare's ""Cymbeline,"" and as Lucifer in ""Doctor Faustus."" Then Christie went to the big screen with roles in Terry Gilliam's ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" (2009), which featured the last performance of Heath Ledger, and ""The Zero Theorem"" (2013). Christie was cast as Brienne of Tarth in ""Game of Thrones"" in July 2011. The character was a cult favorite, and her fans were suggesting online that she would be perfect for the role before she officially came aboard. Christie's first appearance on ""Thrones"" was on the third episode of season two, which aired on April 15, 2012. As Christie's popularity as an actress grew, she landed the role of Commander Lyme in ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part One"" (2014) and its second half, the last two installments of the popular young adult franchise. This led to Christie landing in another major franchise with a fervent fan following. Riding the crest of her popularity, Christie portrayed a key villain in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), the long awaited return of the legendary space opera, alongside Lupita N'yongo and Adam Driver."

Born and raised in San Diego, California, Tran's love of performing started at a very young age. She began appearing in various song and dance productions throughout her hometown, thus honing her craft as a stage performer, before moving to Los Angeles to attend UCLA. While in L.A., Tran jumpstarted her comedic acting career by attending classes at many of the city's major improvisational comedy training programs, like Upright Citizens Brigade, Second City, and IO. With her improv chops growing, Tran made the leap into comedic web videos in 2011 with the short video ""Untouchable."" Over the next few years she would appear in several more comedic web videos and web series, primarily for the comedy website College Humor. Tran also appeared in the pilot for the short-lived NBC sitcom ""About a Boy"" (NBC, 2014-15), as well as a starring role on the comedy web series ""Ladies Like Us"" (2013-15). After about five years of making a name for herself as a comedic force to be reckoned with, Tran, who was a relative unknown, surprised ""Star Wars"" fans the world over when it was announced that she would be appearing in a secretive role in the eighth episode of the science-fiction film series. Furthermore, 2016 was also the year Tran appeared in an indie romantic comedy for Netflix called ""XoXo"" (2016)."

Her track record as a risk-taker and her dedication to well-written female characters on a journey of self-discovery in films like ""Blue Velvet"" (1986) and ""Rambling Rose"" (1991) often meant that her finest work was seen more often in art house cinemas. A growing public interest in upscale cable television movies such as ""Afterburn"" (HBO, 1992), ""Down Came a Blackbird"" (Showtime, 1995) and ""Recount"" (HBO, 2008) provided a second outlet for Dern's facile work with character dramas and dark comedy, leading to multiple Emmy nominations. Of course, Dern starred in major blockbusters like ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and ""Jurassic Park III"" (2001), but she made her career in smaller films like ""I Am Sam"" (2001), ""We Don't Live Here Anymore"" (2004), and ""Year of the Dog"" (2007). The statuesque blonde with the respectable Hollywood pedigree could easily have sold out her sophisticated taste for a fulltime job brandishing weaponry in action thrillers, but she remained true to the offbeat, counterculture leanings of her famous parents, actors Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern. Adding to her list of indelible characters in acclaimed films ranging from Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" (2012) and Kelly Reichart's ""Certain Women"" (2016), Dern was the star of her own series, ""Enlightened"" (HBO. 2011-13), which earned her more acclaim and helped cement her status as one of Hollywood's most unique talents. After reuniting with David Lynch for an unforgettable performance in ""Twin Peaks: The Return"" (Showtime 2017), Dern made her debut in the Star Wars universe with a key role in ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (2017)."

Del Toro first earned considerable praise as the mumbling Fenster in Bryan Singer's enigmatic ensemble crime drama ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995), and went on to a number of supporting roles in films like ""The Fan"" (1996), ""Basquiat"" (1996), ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (1998) and ""Snatch"" (2000). The actor broke through in a big way by winning the Oscar for his performance as a conflicted Mexican police detective caught between corrupt cops and drug cartels in Stephen Soderbergh's epic crime thriller ""Traffic"" (2000). From there, he delivered one of his best turns as an ex-con whose rebuilt life is shattered after causing a fatal car accident in Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu's dark character drama ""21 Grams"" (2003). After donning heavy prosthetics to play the abusive Jackie Boy in ""Sin City"" (2005), Del Toro delivered a commanding performance as Latin American revolutionary Ernesto Guevara in Soderbergh's complex biopic, ""Che"" (2008), before returning to the mainstream as ""The Wolfman"" (2010), a remake of the classic horror tale. Whether starring in brooding indie character dramas or large scale studio films, Del Toro always made sure that he maintained his focus on carefully chosen works that were more substance than style."

Associations with two very different but successful franchises would ensure Davis's income and status as a working actor: the titular gleefully evil ""Leprechaun"" (1993) and all its straight-to-video sequels, as well as Hogwarts professor Filius Flitwick in every big-budget installment of the ""Harry Potter"" series. Proving he had considerable comedic chops on the Ricky Gervais hit series ""Extras"" (BBC Two, 2005-07) led the esteemed comedian to write the BBC comedy pilot ""Life's Too Short"" for Davis in 2010, the same year the actor published his autobiography.

As president, producer and occasionally executive producer, Kennedy oversaw an impressive array of motion pictures, from ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982), ""Back to the Future"" (1985) and ""The Color Purple"" (1985) to ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""

Spielberg even had an indirect hand in Williams composing the music for ""Star Wars"" (1977), perhaps the most iconic and popular film score ever recorded. In all, Williams was decorated with an incalculable number of awards, including Grammys, Oscars and Golden Globes, while earning a reputation for churning out high quality work but with a rare degree of humility and self-effacement. Outside of his work with Spielberg and Lucas, he was responsible for other culturally-prominent scores, including ""Superman: The Movie"" (1978) and ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" (2001).

Born and raised in the Manhattan borough of New York City, Groucho, whose birth name was Julius Henry Marx, and his brothers were encouraged by their mother to put together a vaudeville act when they were young. Having no formal education, Groucho and his brothers began making the rounds on the vaudeville circuit, first as a singing group known as ""The Four Nightingales,"" and later as the comedy act that would become The Marx Brothers. After a number of years honing their act on the vaudeville circuit, The Marx Brothers went on to become one of the most popular vaudeville acts in New York City, even being enough of a draw to put on three successful Broadway musical comedies: ""I'll Say She Is"" (1924-25), ""The Cocoanuts"" (1925-26), and ""Animal Crackers"" (1928-29). The brothers' huge success on stage eventually drew the attention of Hollywood, and over the course of the 1930s and 40s Groucho and his brothers made 13 comedies together, many of which have since been deemed classics of the genre. These Marx Brothers comedies include ""Animal Crackers"" (1930), ""Duck Soup"" (1933), ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935), and ""At the Circus"" (1939). It was also during his thriving film career in the 1930s that Marx became recognizable for his distinctive look of bushy eyebrows, glasses, grease paint mustache, and a cigar. Groucho had developed this idiosyncratic look during his vaudeville days in the early 20s, and retained the look through the remainder of his career. After a stall in his film-acting career in the mid-40s, Groucho began searching for new opportunities in show business. He eventually turned to the thriving new medium called radio and in 1947 debuted the quiz show ""You Bet Your Life"" on ABC radio. The show allowed Marx to interview people and ad-lib on the spot, thus showing off his quick wit, and audiences loved it. In 1950 ""You Bet Your Life"" (NBC, 1950-60) moved over to television, where it would remain on the air for the next decade, becoming one of the most popular shows on television while simultaneously making Groucho Marx a household name. After ""You Bet Your Life"" ended its run, Groucho continued appearing on television and in films, most notably playing a mobster named God in Otto Preminger's trippy 1968 comedy ""Skidoo"" (1969). In 1972 Groucho returned to the stage and performed a one-man show at Carnegie Hall in New York City. That performance was later released as a double album ""An Evening With Groucho"" (1972). By the mid-70s Groucho's health began to decline. He made one of his final public appearances at the 1974 Academy Awards where Jack Lemmon presented him with an honorary Oscar for his numerous contributions to the film industry. In June of 1977 Groucho was hospitalized with pneumonia. He died two months later on August 19, 1977 at the age of 86."

The most fey and absurdist of the brothers, Harpo's art was closer to 19th century French mime than to American vaudeville. He worked as a bellboy while learning the harp which became his trademark. He and older brother Chico formed a comedy duo around the turn of the century, and by the early 1910s he was in vaudeville with Chico, Groucho and Gummo in acts like ""Fun in Hi Skool"" (1911) and ""Welcome Home"" (1914), both penned by their uncle Al Shean."

Wearing a dark curly wig, a pointed hat and a goofy grin, he portrayed an Italian stereotype common in early 20th-century vaudeville which would later be deemed offensive. The eldest of the brothers, Chico (supposedly nicknamed for his success with ""chicks"") started his career with brother Harpo, after teenaged jobs as a pianist and wrestler. Such acts as ""Fun in Hi Skool"" (1911) and """"Home Again"" (1914), helped the brothers hone their stage personalities: notably the smart-mouthed con-man (Groucho), the dumb Italian (Chico) and the mute faun (Harpo)."

Possessing a genial personality and a fine baritone, Jones enjoyed modest success in Hollywood for several years without ever attaining the star status of which he seemed capable. He was played up as a second-string Nelson Eddy, and consequently never developed a distinctive persona of his own. One of his best-remembered moments in film was his singing in ""The Firefly"" (1937) of the tuneful ""The Donkey Serenade,"" which later became something of a trademark song for Jones.

A friend of renowned playwright George S. Kaufman, he became a regular on Broadway by the end of the decade and began appearing in films. Cast for his Germanic presence, he earned regular spots in Marx Brothers pictures including ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"" and the famed comedies of legendary director Ernst Lubtisch such as ""Ninotchka"" and ""To Be or Not to Be."" With the advent of World War II, he saw many Nazi roles come his way, including perhaps his most memorable performance as a POW guard in Billy Wilder's acclaimed drama ""Stalag 17,"" while simultaneously shortening his name to appear slightly less German to critical American wartime audiences.

Equally capable at both broad comedy and drama, he frequently essayed tightly controlled men of authority, including judges, government agents, detectives and medical professionals. Occasionally, his characters spun wildly out of control - a DEA agent who experiences a spectacular LSD trip in ""Flirting With Disaster"" (1996), or staid funeral director Richard Fisher, whose sudden death reveals a long-hidden secret life on the acclaimed series ""Six Feet Under"" (HBO, 2001-05) - which was often the highlight of the project. He was also a favorite performer of the Coen Brothers, appearing in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (2001), ""Intolerable Cruelty"" (2003) and ""Burn After Reading"" (2008). While mainly a character actor, Jenkins finally graduated to leading man status in the independent film ""The Visitor"" (2008), for which he received excellent notices, while also appearing in ""Eat Pray Love"" (2010) and ""The Rum Diary"" (2011).

Spencer's perfect timing and natural sass also helped her land roles in feature comedies such as ""Big Momma's House"" (2000) and ""Beauty Shop"" (2005), as well as a breakout role on Comedy Central's ""Halfway Home"" (2007), appearing as a loudmouthed ex-con who is always picking fights with her housemates.

Unlike his peers, however, del Toro steered away from making art house films about his native Mexico, focusing instead on helming old-fashioned horror movies. Bursting onto the scene with his first effort, ""Cronos"" (1993), del Toro learned how to deal with Hollywood the hard way with his first studio effort, ""Mimic"" (1997). After directing ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), a return to independent film and his native Mexico, he took on Hollywood a second time with ""Blade II"" (2002), only this time with more success. His critically acclaimed adaptation of the comic book ""Hellboy"" (2004) was followed by the critically acclaimed ""Pan's Labyrinth"" (2006), a stark, but dream-like horror fantasy that earned three Academy Awards and helped to make del Toro a rare success in both the United States and his homeland.

His extensive theatrical training proved essential for these larger-than-life roles, which ranged from a vengeful Norse god and a legendary novelist to a courageous but doomed World War I officer. Prior to his emergence on the international scene, Hiddleston was featured largely in supporting roles on U.K. television, but in the wake of ""Thor,"" he became an in-demand player on both sides of the Atlantic. The following year proved an even bigger jackpot, with a reprisal of his villainous ""Thor"" role in ""The Avengers"" (2012) and a starring turn as Prince Hal in PBS productions of ""Henry IV"" and ""Henry V."" More than anything else, it was his versatility and cheeky charm that minted Tom Hiddleston as certified scene stealer on the verge of worldwide stardom."
1042,Cate Blanchett,5/14/1969,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",https://resizing.flixster.com/hOIAFULVHLPeR0O4dIGyKf6g1bU=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/70375_v9_bc.jpg,"A gifted performer who developed her talent at a young age, actress Cate Blanchett grew into an exceptional actress who achieved international acclaim with her Oscar-nominated turn as a young Elizabeth I in ""Elizabeth"" (1998). Prior to that role, the alluring Australian found herself thrust into the spotlight with just her third feature, ""Oscar and Lucinda"" (1997). Post-""Elizabeth,"" Blanchett quickly blossomed into one of Hollywood's most esteemed actresses. Following a prominent turn as a wealthy socialite in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999), she was a Southern woman with psychic abilities in ""The Gift"" (2000), played Kevin Spacey's wife in ""The Shipping News"" (2001) and was the titular slain Irish journalist in ""Veronica Guerin"" (2003). Seemingly favoring smaller films, it came as a surprise that Blanchett appeared as the elf Galadriel in the blockbuster trilogy, ""The Lord of the Rings"" (2001-03), which she followed with a critically hailed performance as Katharine Hepburn in ""The Aviator"" (2004). From there, Blanchett traveled easily from small indies to major studio films, earning acclaim for her work in ""Babel"" (2006), ""Notes on a Scandal"" (2006) and ""I'm Not There"" (2007), to vamping her way through ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). Following further critical praise for ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008), Blanchett delivered memorable turns in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" (2013), winning the Best Actress Oscar for her role, and Todd Haynes' 1950s period piece ""Carol"" (2015), based on Patricia Highsmith's lesbian-themed novel The Price of Salt. Blanchett's range and remarkable skill solidified her status as one of Hollywood's most preeminent performers."
1043,Idris Elba,9/6/1972,"Hackney, England, UK",https://resizing.flixster.com/kL51qhgagaN2i6o75dpeK5Z0iQg=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/178333_v9_bd.jpg,"Idris Elba was a British actor who became known for playing the Baltimore drug dealer Stringer Bell on HBO's widely-acclaimed drama ""The Wire"" (HBO, 2002-08), in addition to countless other high profile television and film roles. Elba was born in Hackney, London in 1972. His parents were immigrants (his father was born in Sierra Leone, while his mother was from Ghana), and moved to London by way of Sierra Leone shortly before Elba was born. Elba grew up in East Ham and Hackney, and first got interested in acting after seeing an advertisement in a London-based entertainment publication. The advertisement was asking newbie actors to audition for a new play. Elba jumped at the opportunity, and showed up at the audition. On his first try, Elba landed the part, and would later meet his first agent while performing in the play. Performing in the play was an eye-opening experience for Elba, who decided quickly after that he wanted to be an actor. At the age of 16 he was able to land a huge break by landing a spot in the National Youth Music Theater, thanks to a grant from the Prince's Trust charitable organization. While a member of the National Youth Music Theater, Elba was able to hone his acting craft, while developing the necessary skills he needed to make it as a performer. It was also around this time that Elba began working for his uncle's wedding D.J. company and found that he absolutely loved scratching records. His love grew so strong that by his late teens Elba embarked on a career as a D.J. He would go on to play music in London nightclubs in the evening, while working a number of odd jobs by the day. In his early 20s Elba made a serious attempt at launching his acting career. In addition to working his D.J. jobs, in which he went by the name of Big Driis, he began auditioning for film and TV roles. By the mid-1990s, Elba was landing steady acting work in the U.K. He nabbed guest spots on the children's sitcom ""2point4 Children"" (BBC One, 1991-99) and the British comedy series ""Absolutely Fabulous"" (BBC Two/BBC One, 1992-2012), before landing a recurring role on the crime series ""The Ruth Rendell Mysteries"" (ITV, 1987-2000). By the late 90s and early 2000s Elba was nabbing recurring parts on a number of British television shows, including ""Insiders"" (BBC One, 1997), ""Ultraviolet"" (Channel 4, 1998), and ""Dangerfield"" (BBC One, 1995-99). Then in 2002 Elba landed his first big break across the pond when he was cast as Stringer Bell, a Baltimore-based drug kingpin, on David Simon's multi-layered crime drama series ""The Wire."" Elba played Stringer Bell for 37 episodes of the widely-acclaimed series, before his character was killed off in season 3. After playing Stringer Bell for three years, Idris Elba's acting career in both the U.K. and the United States flourished. In addition to nabbing parts in high-profile films like ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007) and ""American Gangster"" (2007), he starred as the title character in the BBC crime series ""Luther"" (BBC One, 2010 - ). He also landed a recurring role on the beloved American sitcom ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-2013) in 2009. By the early 2010s Elba's acting profile continued to grow at a rapid pace. He appeared in blockbuster films like ""Thor"" (2011), ""Prometheus"" (2012), and ""Pacific Rim"" (2013), and was also cast as Nelson Mandela in the 2013 bio pic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" (2013). In 2016 Elba was nominated for a Golden Globe for his captivating performance in the drama ""Beasts of No Nation"" (2015), and appeared in the films ""Molly's Game"" (2017) and ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018). 2019 also proved to be a big year for Idris Elba. In addition to co-creating and starring in the Netflix series ""Turn Up Charlie"" (Netflix, 2019- ), a partially autobiographical show that was based on his experiences as a D.J., Elba appeared alongside The Rock and Jason Statham in the blockbuster action film ""Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw"" (2019). When ""Hobbs and Shaw"" was released in the summer of 2019 the film made over $700 billion, making it one of the highest grossing films of the year-just another reason why Idris Elba had certified his status as one of Hollywood's most bankable actors of the 2010s."

After breaking in as a drug-addled thug in ""Death Wish"" (1974), Goldblum spent several years looking for that one breakthrough role that would propel his career to the next level. That role came when he played a seedy magazine journalist who reconnects with his college friends during a funeral in ""The Big Chill"" (1983). But his biggest moment arrived with a star-making leading role in ""The Fly"" (1986), which earned him widespread critical plaudits. Though he spent the next several years in some rather forgettable features, Goldblum reached new heights as an unorthodox scientist in the hit action film ""Jurassic Park"" (1993). Three years later, he starred in one of the biggest box office draws of all time, ""Independence Day"" (1996), which solidified his status as one of Hollywood's top stars. While he maintained a prolific output of film and television over the next two decades, Goldblum took a step back to concentrate on lower-profile independents like ""Igby Goes Down"" (2002) - not at all unusual for the iconoclastic performer."
1045,Karl Urban,6/7/1972,"Wellington, New Zealand",https://resizing.flixster.com/EgvqM751Lgn69J3l-M-EpoUeuQM=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/155467_v9_bb.jpg,"A sturdy lead and character actor with a natural affinity for physical roles, Karl Urban was a New Zealand-born performer who rose to popularity with notable roles in ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" (2002) and ""The Return of the King"" (2003), as well as ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004) and ""Doom"" (2005). Urban excelled at playing men of action, like the proud horseman in Peter Jackson's fantasy epics and the cold-blooded killer in ""Bourne,"" but fans who took the time to explore Urban's cv found more subtle performances in smaller projects like ""The Price of Milk"" (2000), which cast him as a romance-minded farmer, or ""Out of the Blue"" (2006), where he played a small town policeman caught in the middle of a shootout. His adaptability in a variety of genres kept him busy in Hollywood features, which reached a high point when he was cast as Dr. McCoy in J. J. Abrams' origin story for ""Star Trek"" (2009). It also made him a capable and highly watchable actor whose star continued to ascend with each subsequent project."
1046,Anthony Hopkins,12/31/1937,"Margam, Port Talbot, Wales, UK",https://resizing.flixster.com/NQfX2PQv0t2tjYvk5VP5qevAQoQ=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/5729_v9_bc.jpg,"From a young age, Anthony Hopkins gravitated towards creativity and the arts. Born in 1937, he grew up in Wales, often struggling in school. As a teenager, a chance meeting with actor Richard Burton, also from Wales, inspired Hopkins to immerse himself in acting, attending drama schools with a brief two-year break serving in the British Army. Moving to London, Hopkins first took the stage in 1960. A mentorship relationship with Laurence Olivier helped fuel his young career and he made the leap from stage to screen by the late '60s. His first major role was as Richard I in ""The Lion in Winter"" (1968). While he still performed regularly in the theater, Hopkins continued to work on TV and film, following up his debut with ""War and Peace"" (BBC 1972). His most notable roles in the '70s are likely his pair of films directed by Richard Attenborough: ""Young Winston"" (1972) and the war epic ""A Bridge Too Far"" (1977). At the start of the next decade, he dazzled as Dr. Frederick Treves in David Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"" (1980). While his acting talent was apparent to all who saw him perform, Hopkins finally cracked through in a clear mainstream way with his Academy Award-winning turn as Dr. Hannibal Lector in Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). It kicked off an impressive run for the actor as he followed it up with Oscar nominations for his roles in ""The Remains of the Day"" (1993), ""Nixon"" (1995), and ""Amistad"" (1997). In the early '90s, he was prolific, additionally appearing in ""Howards End"" (1992), ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), ""Chaplin"" (1992), and ""Shadowlands"" (1993). At the turn of the century, he reprised his role as Hannibal Lector in ""Hannibal"" (2001) and ""Red Dragon"" (2002). While his '90s pace wasn't replicated in the 2000s, Hopkins was still a busy actor, dotting the next decade of his career with starring roles in films such as ""The World's Fastest Indian"" (2005) and ""Fracture"" (2007), in addition to appearances in ""Alexander"" (2004) and ""The Wolfman"" (2010). In 2011, he appeared as Odin in the Marvel film ""Thor"" (2011), a part which he'd reprise several times in the next decade. Hopkins also starred in the sci-fi adaptation of ""Westworld"" (HBO 2016- ). He also received much acclaim for his performances in ""King Lear"" (BBC 2018) and ""The Two Popes"" (2019)."
1047,Benedict Cumberbatch,7/19/1976,"London, England, UK",https://resizing.flixster.com/_MgD5Duw4CaPEIgFv6gU_ire1Zk=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/275459_v9_bb.jpg,"One of the most well-respected British thespians of his generation, Benedict Cumberbatch may have taken the classic route to acting fame: spouting off Shakespeare at drama school, followed by BBC roles and eventually films, but his type of fame is decidedly 21st century. Cumberbatch is beloved by a very devoted cadre of fans, who line the stranger corners of the internet with all sorts of fan art and memes dedicated to their favorite actor. From Oscar nominated prestige dramas to Marvel superhero tentpole blockbusters, there was no limit to Cumberbatch's range, one might even call him a leading man disguised as an eccentric character actor. Born on July 19. 1976 in London to actors Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham, Cumberbatch came from literal royalty: his third cousin sixteen times removed was Richard III. While away at boarding school, Cumberbatch became interested in acting. He made his stage debut at the age of 12, playing Titania, Queen of the Fairies, in a school production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" Before university, Cumberbatch took a gap year to teach English at a Tibetan monastery, which began a lifetime of studying Buddhist philosophy. After earning his masters in Classical Acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), Cumberbatch began working on the stage. His breakthrough in the UK came when he was cast as Stephen Hawking in the miniseries ""Hawking"" (BBC, 2004), soon followed by an acclaimed role in the film ""Amazing Grace"" (2006). Cumberbatch next earned his first lead role, in the miniseries ""The Last Enemy"" (BBC, 2008), before landing the part that would make him a cause celebrae on both sides of the pond: Sherlock Holmes. ""Sherlock"" (BBC/PBS, 2012-) was a thoroughly modern take on Arthur Conan Doyle's classic sleuth: Cumberbatch's Holmes was acerbic and dangerous, and with Martin Freeman's Watson as his foil, Cumberbatch got to delightfully chew the scenery. His performance in the third season netted him an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. Speaking of movies, Cumberbatch's next big role was as a lovesick closeted spy hunting down a mole in Tomas Alfredsson's acclaimed take on the John le CareÃ© classic ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" (2011). Thanks to his growing online fandom, Cumberbatch soon found himself on the radar of major filmmakers casting big tentpole projects: for Peter Jackson he lended his voice to the villainous dragon Smaug across three films: ""The Hobbit; An Unexpected Journey"" (2012), ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" (2013), and ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies"" (2014), while also taking on the role of the legendary sci-fi heavy, Khan, for JJ Abrams's ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" (2013). For his turn as Alan Turing, inventor of the modern computer who was tormented by British law for his homosexuality, in the drama ""The Imitation Game"" (2014), Cumberbatch received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. This also lead to Cumberbatch signing an open letter, published in The Guardian on January 31, 2015, asking the British government to pardon all gay and bisexual men who were convicted under the same defunct ""indecency"" laws as Alan Turing. Cumberbatch was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2015 for his services on behalf of the arts and charity. For his next role, Cumberbatch took on the titular role of ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) in Marvel's most psychedelic superhero adventure yet. He would reprise the role for ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) and ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019). Cumberbatch earned another Emmy nomination for his lead role in the miniseries ""Patrick Melrose"" (HBO, 2018), before taking things full circle to the beginning of his career by taking the job of president of LAMDA, his old alma mater. Cumberbatch could next be seen in Sam Mendes' World War I drama ""1917"" (2019)."

Beginning with his work as a member of the New Zealand National Film Unit, Neill began to make a name for himself in his homeland with small films like ""Sleeping Dogs"" (1977). After moving to Australia for various film and television work, he received international exposure with the third entry in the popular ""Omen"" horror series as Damian Thorn in ""The Final Conflict"" (1981). From there it was on to a nearly uninterrupted run of impressive performances alongside some of film's biggest stars in projects such as the underrated ""Dead Calm"" (1989), co-starring Nicole Kidman, and the Academy Award-winning ""The Piano"" (1993), featuring Harvey Keitel and Holly Hunter. Neill then headlined one of the biggest blockbuster films of all time as the levelheaded Dr. Alan Grant in Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" (1993). Almost effortlessly, he would continue to move from genres ranging from horror (1995's ""In the Mouth of Madness""), to comedy (2000's ""The Dish""), to historical drama (the 2007 season of Showtime's ""The Tudors""), and back again with apparent ease. Over the years, the once supposedly camera shy Neill had steadily become one of the most welcome international presences on screen - be it film or television - of his generation."

Further rounding out her considerable talents were a pair of breakout performances in the indie horror films ""Rest Stop"" (2006) and ""The Other Side"" (2006), and a multi-episode arc as Edie Falco's hard-partying sister-in-law on the medical drama ""Nurse Jackie"" (Showtime, 2009-15). No stranger to hard work (she was a member of her high school wrestling team), Alexander proved up to the challenge of becoming a star."
1050,Taika Waititi,8/16/1975,"Raukokore, New Zealand",https://resizing.flixster.com/22fYuJMgHLk7NeCoUET4DLA0l0s=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/590955_v9_bc.jpg,"Kiwi filmmaker Taika Waititi's gift for uproarious and absurd humor served him well as director on such films as ""What We Do in the Shadows"" (2014), ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017), which freely mixed humor with horror, action-adventure and other genres. He was born Taika David Waititi in Raukokore, a settlement on New Zealand's North Island, on August 16, 1975. Raised in the country's capital city of Wellington by a Maori father and a Russian Jewish mother, Waititi initially planned to become a painter or a deepsea diver, but fell in love with acting after appearing in high school drama productions. While studying theater and film at Victoria University of Wellington, he also began performing as part of a comedy group, So You're a Man, which also included Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords. The group parted ways after several successful productions in 1996 and 1997, but Waititi and Clement would reunite as a new comedy act, the Humourbeasts, in 1999. The duo's show, ""The Untold Tales of Maui,"" proved exceptionally popular throughout New Zealand and earned them the Billy T. Award, given to up-and-coming New Zealand comedy talent, in 1999. The following year, Waititi co-starred in the dark comedy ""Scarfies"" (2000), which earned him an NZ Film Award nomination for his turn as a college student who becomes involved in a kidnapping plot. More supporting roles followed, including the road trip comedy ""Snakeskin"" (2001) and a male stripper on ""The Strip"" (TV3, 2002-2003). But he soon tired of playing broad sidekick roles, and made his debut as writer and director on the short ""John and Pogo"" (2002). He struck paydirt with his second effort, ""Two Cars, One Night"" (2004), a short about two boys and a girl in a parking lot that blossomed into an unexpectedly sweet fable. The film was a remarkable success on the festival and awards circuit, netting an Oscar nomination for Best Live Action short, among numerous other accolades. Waititi would direct several more shorts, including an early version of ""What We Do in Shadows"" (2005) with Clement, before making his feature debut with ""Eagle vs. Shark"" (2007). An offbeat romantic comedy with Clement and Loren Taylor as a pair of eccentrics who find love, the film won several festival awards, including Best Screenplay at the US Comedy Arts Festival, which in turn led to Waititi's inclusion on a list of ten ""directors to watch"" by Variety.. After helming a quartet of episodes of  ""Conchords"" (HBO, 2007-2009), he cemented that status with his next film, the comedy-drama ""Boy"" (2010), about an 11-year-old Maori boy whose elaborate fantasies about his ex-con father (played by Waititi) are tested when he turns up with members of his gang. A huge hit in New Zealand, it paved the way for a feature-length version of ""What We Do in Shadows"" (2014), a mockumentary-style comedy with Waititi, Clement and comic actor Jonny Brugh as mismatched vampires trying to co-exist in modern New Zealand. A cult favorite in the States and abroad, it later generated two spin-off series, including an American sitcom based on the film for the FX Network and co-produced by Waititi and Clement. Waititi's string of successes continued unbroken with his next film, ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" (2014), with Sam Neill and Julian Dennison as an outdoorsman and his juvenile delinquent foster son, who become the subject of a manhunt. Though Waititi had expressed reticence in working on a major studio feature, he won over Marvel Studios with a demo reel he created for its upcoming Thor feature. The reel's tone - a mix of special effects-driven action clips and comedy - won over Marvel, which tapped him to direct ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017). Waititi's approach, which freely mixed broad comedy and superhero action, not only revived waning interest in the Thor franchise, but also provided Marvel with a hit that pleased diehard fans and casual viewers alike. The success of ""Ragnarok"" - it was the ninth highest-grossing film of 2017 - opened numerous doors for Waititi, who responded with a slew of new projects, including the dark fantasy ""Jojo Rabbit"" (2019), about a young German boy whose imaginary playmate is Adolf Hitler (played by Waititi), and a live-action version of the iconic anime film ""Akira"" (2021). On the television front, Waititi was tapped to direct an episode of Lucasfilm's ""The Mandalorian"" (Disney+, 2019- ), and a series version of Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits."""

At first, he used his manic onscreen persona to great effect in early hits like ""Night Shift"" (1982) and ""Mr. Mom"" (1983); the former of which put him on the map, while the latter turned him into a star. But it was his wild turn as a perverse ghost in Tim Burton's ""Beetlejuice"" (1988) and his compelling dramatic performance as a cocaine addict trying to get his life together in ""Clean and Sober"" (1988) that showcased his true talents. Keaton reached new heights when he won the title role in Burton's take on ""Batman"" (1989). His casting surprised many - and angered some - though when the finished film was released, most were in agreement that Keaton's brooding performance was inspired. After the inevitable sequel, ""Batman Returns"" (1992), Keaton's career entered a commercial and critical downturn with films like ""Jack Frost"" (1998), or little-seen indies like ""Quicksand"" (2001) that barely saw the light of day. He emerged onto the small screen with an acclaimed turn in ""Live from Bagdad"" (HBO, 2002), a reminder that Keaton was capable of handling any role in any genre or medium. After settling into a solid career as a character actor, Keaton returned to public consciousness with a career-redefining role in the Oscar-winning ""Birdman"" (2014). Further work in another Best Picture winner, ""Spotlight"" (2015), Ray Kroc biopic ""The Founder"" (2016) and superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017) proved that Michael Keaton had managed a late-career renaissance."

Thanks to those rather harsh characters, audiences were understandably surprised by her effectively heartwarming performances in the sentimental Nicholas Sparks romance ""The Notebook"" (2004) and as a likeable girl-next-door in the comedy smash ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005). The sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette, sometimes pink-haired actress enjoyed roles just as unpredictable as her appearance, delivering all of them with the same sparkling panache as her flair for personal style. Her romances with actors Ryan Gosling, Josh Lucas and Michael Sheen fascinated the press and fans alike, proving the actress' appeal extended beyond the screen. After turning to horror for the compelling ""Red Eye"" (2005), McAdams threw moviegoers for a loop yet again with starring roles in the retro thriller ""Married Life"" (2008) and in an adaptation of the best-selling novel ""The Traveler's Wife"" (2008), before playing a junior reporter in the political thriller ""State of Play"" (2009). That same year, she co-starred in the studio blockbuster ""Sherlock Holmes"" (2009) and later reprised her role in the sequel, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" (2011), while starring opposite Owen Wilson in Woody Allen's ""Midnight in Paris"" (2011), starring in the second season of cable drama ""True Detective"" (HBO 2014- ), and receiving an Academy Award nomination for her work in the ensemble drama ""Spotlight"" (2015). Thanks to wide-ranging performances and an utterly likable onscreen persona, McAdams kept audiences on their toes in a variety of films."

Recurring roles on a string of high-profile programs like ""Will and Grace"" (NBC, 1998-2006), ""Sex and the City"" (HBO, 1998-2004), ""Ed"" (NBC, 2000-04) and ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC, 2004-2012) made him a casting agent's go-to for flinty and occasionally unyielding authority figures. Appearances in major motion pictures like ""Traffic"" (2000), ""Flags of Our Fathers"" (2006) and ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (2007) preceded perhaps his most widely-recognized character, playing the hard-drinking, chain-smoking philanderer and advertising executive Roger Sterling on ""Mad Men"" (AMC, 2007-2015). Exuding a devil-may-care attitude and old school charm, Slattery's performance earned him considerable acclaim and status as one of the show's favorite characters. Because of his newfound prominence, Slattery was rewarded with supporting turns in big movies like ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) and a profile that was finally on the rise."

James mainly acted in films like the crime picture ""Exiled"" (1999) with Paul Ronan during the early stages of his career. He continued to work steadily in television throughout the early 2000s and the 2010s, appearing on ""The Good Wife"" (2009-16) and ""Person of Interest"" (2011-16). He appeared in ""G"" (2005) with Richard T Jones and ""Ghost Town"" (2008) in the early 2000s and the 2010s.

After playing a soldier in the Broadway play ""The Queen and the Rebels"" (1982), Tucci made his feature debut as a hood in John Huston's ""Prizzi's Honor"" (1985) and soon developed into a highly respected character actor in films like ""Billy Bathgate"" (1991), ""The Pelican Brief"" (1993) and the HBO biopic ""Winchell"" (1998). Alternating between independent films and big budget features, Tucci came within reach of stardom with his delightful performance as proud Italian chef Secondo Pilaggi in ""Big Night"" (1996), directed by Campbell Scott from a script by Tucci. He went on to portray a wide range of characters on television and in film, playing Puck in ""William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (1999) and directing the indie ""Joe Gould's Secret"" (2001). He played Adolph Eichmann in ""Conspiracy"" (HBO, 2001), mobster Frank Nitti in ""The Road to Perdition"" (2002), and Stanley Kubrick in ""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" (HBO, 2004). After stealing scenes from Meryl Streep in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2006) and ""Julie & Julia"" (2009), he earned his first Oscar nomination for playing serial killer George Harvey in ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009).

In fact, Crudup's intensity and his ability to disappear into character marked him as a highly gifted actor, though this same ability often played against the conventional wisdom for his becoming a movie star. He turned in strong and potentially star-making turns in more conventional features like ""Without Limits"" (1998) and ""The Hi-Lo Country"" (1998). Even when success eluded him when he was rock guitarist Russell Hammond in Cameron Crowe's well-received ""Almost Famous"" (2000), Crudup seemed to relish the freedom of not being a household name. That started to change with higher profile turns in ""Big Fish"" (2003), ""Mission: Impossible 3"" (2006), the highly anticipated ""Watchmen"" (2009) and the acclaimed made-for-cable television movie ""Too Big to Fail"" (HBO, 2011), all of which threatened to turn Crudup into a star, whether he wanted to be or not."

Sheridan made his film debut with a bit part in ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1985). He moved on to larger roles, including a co-starring part as the jealous boyfriend in ""Distant Thunder"" (1988) and the lead in a TV series ""Shannon's Deal"" (NBC, 1990-91), created by John Sayles. On the short-lived series, he was a highly-paid corporate lawyer who left the high life to return to the trenches as a district attorney. On the heels of the TV series came the release of ""Stanley & Iris"" (1990) in which Sheridan portrayed Jane Fonda's angry, unemployed brother-in-law. He then segued to playing love interests for leading ladies: he was Harley Jane Kozak's estranged husband in ""All I Want for Christmas"" (1991); Melanie Griffith's detective partner who wanted much more in ""A Stranger Among Us"" (1992); and a dashing pilot who romances Annabella Sciorra in ""Whispers in the Dark"" (1992). Sheridan had further success on the small screen as the villainous Randall Flagg in ""Stephen King's 'The Stand'"" (ABC, 1994) and that same year starred opposite Meredith Baxter in ""My Breast"" (CBS).

But in 2002, Cariou hit his theatrical stride once again with a noted run in the embattled Broadway play, ""Proof."" Though the show itself was short-lived, Cariou enjoyed renewed career vigor and began turning in sharp performances on series television, while earning an Emmy Award nomination for his turn as Franklin D.

Creighton went on to make his screen debut in LGBT satire ""Fake ID"" (2003), appear in several web series and off-Broadway productions, and co-found experimental theater troupe New York Neo-Futurists. In 2009, Creighton used his own experiences of working at the Playwrights Horizons to write and star in ""Jack in a Box"" (2009-2012), a comedic web series about a disgruntled theater box office employee.

Prior to his turn to directing, McCarthy made a name for himself on stage, forming a noted comedy improv troupe in college before exploring the depths of Shakespeare in several productions.

But it was his first film, ""The Station Agent,"" which starred the 4'5"" actor Peter Dinklage, that propelled McCarthy's status, especially after the film was nominated for a number of critics and festival awards. By the time he directed his second film, ""The Visitor,"" which earned equal amounts of critical praise and award nominations, McCarthy was well on his way to developing a reputation as a versatile and talented artist. That view was confirmed when McCarthy's film ""Spotlight"" (2016) won Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards."

In 2002, he played a shadowy assistant to Michael Caine's British journalist in ""The Quiet American,"" one of the more critically acclaimed films of the year. This gave his career a boost, and he subsequently landed his highest-profile film yet: the Coen Brothers' 2004 remake of ""The Ladykillers,"" which allowed Ma to show off a more comedic side.

Wang was born in Beijing, China and lived there with her family when she was a young girl. At the age of 6, Wang moved with her parents to Miami, Florida. She would remain in the Sunshine State throughout her formative years. Encouraged by her parents, Wang began taking piano lessons at the age of 4 and quickly showed promise. She attended the prestigious New World School of the Arts in Miami for piano performance and showed immediate promise as a classical pianist. When it came time to enter college Wang was accepted into Boston College. She doubled majored in literature and music at the school, and went on to graduate in 2005. Although music had been one of her main focuses throughout her life, Wang longed to be making films. So after graduation she packed her bags and headed west to Hollywood. While living and working as a film producer's intern in L.A., Wang met fellow filmmaking aspirant Bernadette Burgi. The two hit it off and before long decided to start their own production company - Flying Box Productions. With Burgi serving as producer, Wang released her directorial debut with 2014's ""Posthumous."" That film, which starred Brit Marling and Jack Huston, was written and directed by Wang. Wang's follow-up film, ""The Farewell,"" premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. The film starred Awkwafina as a young Chinese-American woman who travels to China to visit her dying grandmother. ""The Farwell"" was released theatrically in the U.S. in July of 2019."

""Pie,"" with its mix of raucous comedy and heartfelt charm, put the brothers on the comedy map, but the gentler, more mature ""Boy"" established them as versatile talents. Weitz struggled with ""Compass,"" which marked his debut as a director without Paul, but found his footing again as a producer of his brother's work, among others, and as director of ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" (2009), the hotly anticipated sequel to the tween sensation, ""Twilight"" (2007). Weitz's ability to bring a fresh outlook to a wide variety of genres made him one of Hollywood's most versatile and in-demand filmmakers."

Pre-fame, Oyelowo was seen regularly in British households as a cast member on the hit spy series ""MI-5"" (BBC, 2002-11) and he successfully segued into film with solid performances in pictures like ""The Last King of Scotland"" (2006) and ""Who Do You Love"" (2008). He also continued to act on stage and established his own theatre company. Oyelowo gained additional mass audience exposure by appearing in the hit films ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011) and ""The Help"" (2011), and was also featured in Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" (2012), and the Tom Cruise vehicle ""Jack Reacher"" (2012). With his exemplary background in live theatre, solid experience in series television, and increasing presence in feature films, Oyelowo demonstrated solid credentials and became a breakout international star with his impassioned performance as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the civil rights tale ""Selma"" (2014), a role that greatly expanded his international visibility."

True to his working class roots, Wilkinson remained relatively low-key and distinctly non-Hollywood, despite having starred in some of the new millennium's most significant films. He made his breakthrough the previous decade, however, starting with Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995) and followed with ""The Full Monty"" (1997), a surprising hit in the United States despite its origins across the pond. He went on to play major roles in a wide array of films, from small independents like ""In the Bedroom"" and ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (2002) to Hollywood blockbusters like ""Rush Hour"" (1998) and ""Batman Begins"" (2005). Wilkinson delivered a memorable turn as the inventor of an experimental memory-erasing technique in ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (2004) and was a high-profile corporate attorney who loses his mind in ""Michael Clayton"" (2007). On cable, he was delightful as a roguish Benjamin Franklin in the acclaimed miniseries ""John Adams"" (HBO, 2008) and had an award-worthy turn as patriarch Joseph Kennedy in the miniseries ""The Kennedys"" (ReelzChannel, 2011), all which affirmed his status as one of acting's most respected and versatile talents."

Born on October 22, 1973 in the Kensington neighborhood of London, England, Ejogo was the eldest child and only daughter of a Scottish mother, Elizabeth Douglas (whom Ejogo once said was ""a bit of a hippie"") and a Nigerian father, Charles Ejogo. Her younger brother, Charles Jr., was born in 1976. As a child, Ejogo attended the Oratory Roman Catholic Primary School and Glendower Preparatory School. At the age of 13, Ejogo made her film debut in the new wave musical ""Absolute Beginners"" (1986), starring David Bowie. She went on to study performance at Godolphin and Latymer School. At the age of 23, Ejogo made her TV debut, co-starring in the four-part dystopian miniseries ""Cold Lazarus"" (Channel 4/BBC One, 1996). She contributed vocals to the song ""Slowly"" by trip-hop artist Tricky, and before long they became a couple. Ejogo and Tricky were married in 1998, but the marriage was over in a matter of months. Leaving her failed marriage behind, Ejogo next put her vocal talents to use in Kenneth Branaugh's Shakespearian adaptation ""Loves Labour's Lost"" (2000), before playing Coretta Scott King, civil rights activist and wife of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in the biopic ""Boycott"" (2001). While filming, she and the film's MLK, Jeffrey Wright, fell in love in real life, and were married in 2000, eventually giving birth to two kids. She next starred alongside Martin Lawrence and Danny DeVito in the crime comedy ""What's the Worst That Could Happen?"" (2001), before becoming a regular on the crime drama ""Kidnapped"" (NBC, 2006-2007). After that show ended, she took a part in Sam Mendes' romantic dramedy ""Away We Go"" (2009), before playing Fay Carson on the comedic drama ""CHAOS"" (CBS, 2011), and then starring on the short-lived conspiracy thriller ""Zero Hour"" (ABC, 2013). For her return to the big screen, Ejogo once again signed on to play Coretta Scott King, this time to David Oyelowo's MLK, in Ava DuVernay's acclaimed drama ""Selma"" (2014), and followed that up with another real life role: Jane, paramour to heroin-addled jazz great Chet Baker (Ethan Hawke) in ""Born to Be Blue"" (2015). She was next invited to join the Harry Potter universe, playing Seraphina Picquery, president of the wizards, in the prequel ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (2016). 2017 proved to be Ejogo's biggest year yet, as she starred in three big projects: Trey Edward Shults' post-apocalyptic horror ""It Comes at Night"" (2017), Ridley Scott's return to the land of xenomorphs, ""Alien: Covenant"" (2017), and Dan Gilroy's legal drama ""Roman J. Israel, Esq."" (2017), starring a gloriously afro'd Denzel Washington in the titular role. After reprising the role of Seraphina Picquery in ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" (2018), Ejogo could most recently be seen on the third installment of ""True Detective"" (HBO, 2014-), in which she played Amelia Reardon, a school teacher and wife to a cop (Mahershala Ali) who is haunted by an unsolved murder/kidnapping, and later writes a best-selling true crime novel about the case."

After building a solid reputation with guest spots on various popular series, Ribisi first made an impact with his portrayal of the bizarre yet lovable Frank, Jr. in several episodes of the hit sitcom ""Friends"" (NBC, 1994-2004). Supporting work in director Tom Hanks' dramedy ""That Thing You Do!"" (1996) and the lead role in Richard Linklater's indie offering, ""SubUrbia"" (1996) quickly made him a young talent to watch. Ribisi stuck with the winning formula when he appeared alongside Hanks in Steven Spielberg's harrowing ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1999) then garnered acclaim as the star of the stock market drama, ""Boiler Room"" (2000). He frequently delivered unnerving performances as disturbed or outright unlikable characters in high-profile projects like ""The Gift"" (2000) and ""Cold Mountain"" (2003). And despite appearing in his fair share of big budget flops like ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (2004) and ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (2004), Ribisi could always be depended upon to bring something just left-of-center to each character he played. By the turn of the decade, he had become one of the more sought after character actors, appearing in mainstream features like ""Avatar"" (2009), ""The Rum Diary"" (2011) and ""Contraband"" (2012). The talented Ribisi never failed to surprise audiences with characters that combined a mix of the better and baser elements of human nature, though not always in equal measure."

After college, Alessandro Nivola became a rising stage star thanks to his work in regional theater and his 1995 Broadway debut as the young lover of Helen Mirren in ""A Month in the Country."" Inevitably, film and television roles were offered; the handsome, light-haired actor appeared in the 1996 NBC miniseries ""Danielle Steel's 'The Ring'"" and landed his first film role as Joanna Going's preppy husband in ""Inventing the Abbotts"" before landing his breakthrough part as Nicolas Cage's paranoid schizophrenic brother in John Woo's ""Face/Off"" (both 1997). Nivola adopted a flawless British accent to play a mystery man from Rachel Weisz's past in ""I Want You"" (1998), directed by Michael Winterbottom. The chameleonic actor continued to add to his gallery of characters appearing in the thriller ""Best Laid Plans"" and again as an Englishman in Patricia Rozema's screen version of yet another Jane Austen novel ""Mansfield Park"" (both 1999)."

After starting his career as a backup break dancer for Lionel Ritchie at the 1984 Olympic Games, Gooding forged ahead with an acting career with several brief film and television appearances before showing early talent with his subtle portrayal of a bright youth being led down a dangerous path in ""Boyz N the Hood"" (1991). The role earned him serious consideration from Hollywood, though he failed to take advantage of his newfound clout. For the next few years, he languished in forgettable movies like ""Lightning Jack"" (1994) and ""Outbreak"" (1995) before finally striking Oscar gold with his highly infectious performance as an arrogant football star in the winning ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996). But like ""Boyz,"" Gooding failed to seize the moment, choosing instead to star in ""Snow Dogs"" (2002), ""Boat Trip"" (2002) and ""Daddy Day Camp"" (2007). Though he received strong critical attention for his performances in ""As Good As It Gets"" (1998), ""Radio"" (2003) and ""American Crime Story"" (FX 2016- ), Gooding still had work to do in living up to his early promise."

Equally at home in both comedy and drama, Roth made an immediate impression as an unrepentant skinhead - complete with swastika tattoo on his forehead - in his first onscreen performance, ""Made in Britain"" (1982). He quickly became in demand after playing an assassin-in-training in ""The Hit"" (1984), then made a name for himself in the United States as a troubled Vincent Van Gogh in Robert Altman's ""Vincent & Theo"" (1990). But it was his work with Quentin Tarantino in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) that cemented his status as one of the top stars of the independent world. (Unlike many of Tarantino's favorite actors, however, he did not work with the writer/director often; two decades separated his appearances in the anthology ""Four Rooms"" (1995) and the violent western ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015).) Following an Oscar-nominated turn in ""Rob Roy"" (1995), Roth settled into playing varying degrees of malcontents before cracking big-budget Hollywood with major roles in ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001) and ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008). All the while, he continued to work regularly in smaller films on both sides of the Atlantic, such as Michel Haneke's English-language remake of his own ""Funny Games"" (2007) and Ava DuVernay's ""Selma"" (2014)."

Born to an unwed teen mother in rural Mississippi in 1954, Winfrey grew up in Mississippi, Minnesota, and Tennessee as she moved between the homes of her mother, grandmother, and other relatives. Raised in extreme poverty, Winfrey nonetheless excelled as a student and as a speaker, winning a full scholarship to Tennessee State University through an oratory competition. By this point, Winfrey was already reading the news part-time for local radio station WVOL which she continued to do in college. After graduating, she became a TV news anchor for WLAC-TV in Nashville. Winfrey would land a number of news anchor jobs around the country before moving to Chicago to become the host of a low rated talk show called ""AM Chicago"" (WLS, 1984-86). Within months Winfrey's revamp of the program had it beating then-ratings juggernaut ""Donahue"" (Syndicated, 1967-1995). Though she paused in the middle of this ascent to star in the wildly acclaimed film ""The Color Purple"" (1985), Winfrey soon built upon her talk show success, signing a new deal to host her own syndicated talk show titled ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" (Syndicated, 1985-2011). The show began as a tabloid style talk show typical of its time, but Winfrey eventually broadened the range of topics and adjusted the tone to one more serious. She continued to act, starring on the series ""Brewster Place"" (ABC, 1990) and later executive producing and starring in the film ""Beloved"" (1998). All the while, Winfrey's media empire grew. She co-founded the cable networks Oxygen and later OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, and launched O Magazine in 2004. After opting to finally conclude ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" in 2011, Winfrey began hosting the more niche spirituality themed interview show ""Super Soul Sunday"" (OWN, 2011-). She would go on to work most often as an executive producer, bringing acclaimed series like ""Queen Sugar"" (OWN, 2016-) and ""When They See Us"" (Netflix, 2019) to the screen."

Common began his career as a cult figure in alternative hip-hop in the early 1990s, at a time when commercial rap was dominated by warring gangstas from both coasts. With his literary lyrics focused more on love and spirituality than drugs and guns, Common built a following among music critics and hip-hop fans alienated by the negative direction of gangsta rap. He earned some backlash for doing so, but eventually triumphed in the late 1990s amidst a growing revival of old school hip-hop. Following a number of best-selling, Grammy-winning albums, he began an acting career. Unlike Common's musical content, which was socially outspoken and positive, his early supporting film roles found him playing just the type of street thugs his music had railed against. As he began to find his footing in action and comedy features, Common proved that his magnetism and persona as a stage performer translated quite well to characters ranging from his starring role in Western railroad drama ""Hell On Wheels"" (AMC 2011-16) to comedy ""Barbershop: The Next Cut"" (2016) to supervillain blockbuster ""Suicide Squad"" (2016). He maintained his musical credibility as well, winning Best Original Song at the 2015 Academy Awards for ""Glory,"" his collaboration with John Legend for the film ""Selma"" (2014) and being nominated for the same award three years later for ""Stand Up for Something,"" a collaboration with Diane Warren, for the film ""Marshall"" (2017)."

Born in St. Louis, MO in 1979, Thatch made his professional acting debut at the age of 17, appearing in an episode of the series ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" (Fox, 1990-2000). He would go on to take acting classes at UCLA, in addition to ongoing acting work that included recurring roles on ""The Parent 'Hood"" (WB, 1995-99) and ""American Dreams"" (NBC, 2002-05), and an appearance in the film ""The Players' Club"" (1998). In 2004, Thatch was cast in a major advertising campaign by the beer company Budweiser playing a self-absorbed professional athlete known as Leon, who pulled stunts like taking a call from his agent while on deck in the batter's box. The commercials were a major hit, and Thatch used their popularity as an opportunity to pursue his own dream of a sports career, pitching for minor league baseball team the Schaumburg Flyers during the 2005 season. He then took a break from the public eye, eventually returning to show business in 2017 when he personally lobbied director Ava DuVernay via Twitter to cast him in the role of Malcolm X in the movie ""Selma"" (2014). The effort paid off when Thatch won the role. He subsequently took on the character of Captain Robert Torres on the series ""Valor"" (CW, 2017-)."

After establishing himself as a youth run amok, most notably in ""Badlands"" (1973), Sheen grew over the years into a patriarchal figure whose rectitude and social responsibility kept with his liberal Catholic activism.  A proud family man who saw all four children enter the acting business, with sons Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen enjoying lucrative careers of their own, he was perhaps most noted for his performance in Francis Ford Coppola's storied ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), on which he suffered a near-fatal heart attack while seen onscreen in a drunken, unscripted meltdown the director incorporated into the finished product. But he subdued his rebellious ways with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous, while putting his political activism to the fore with an enduring portrayal of an idealistic president on ""The West Wing"" (NBC, 1999-2006), which allowed him to put his two greatest passions - acting and activism - on full display."

After experiencing success with the award-winning documentaries ""This is the Life"" (2008) and ""My Mic Sounds Nice: The Truth About Women in Hip-Hop"" (BET, 2010), DuVernay turned her focus to narratives features with the acclaimed tale of moving on from grief, ""I Will Follow"" (2011), the first release from her industry-changing collective, the African-American Film Festival Releasing Movement (AFFRM). DuVernay impressed critics even further with her follow-up, ""Middle of Nowhere"" (2012), the story of a woman (Emayatzy Corinealdi) who makes enormous personal sacrifices to support her incarcerated husband (Omari Hardwick) but eventually reaches a personal crossroads. Her film dramatizing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1965 civil rights march, ""Selma"" (2014), was even more acclaimed. Earning massive acclaim across the board, DuVernay made history as the first African-American winner of Best Director from the Sundance Film Festival. Blessed with a huge talent to match her social conscience, Ava DuVernay excited critics and fans who were proud to join her in championing challenging African-American independent films of depth and substance. DuVernay also broke ground on television with a collaboration with longtime friend and mentor Oprah Winfrey, ""Queen Sugar"" (OWN 2016- ) and was tapped to direct the film version of the classic children's fantasy ""A Wrinkle In Time,"" making her the first African-American woman to helm a feature with a  budget over one hundred million dollars."

He found his first success as a novelist and on screen when A Gun for Sale (1936) was made into the iconic Alan Ladd film noir ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942) and Brighton Rock (1938) propelled Richard Attenborough's career with a 1947 feature of the same name.

As a young man he handled himself admirably in Milo Forman's ""Valmont"" (1989) opposite classically-trained thespian Colin Firth, and even managed to bring some depth to the role of a young Norman Bates in ""Psycho IV: The Beginning"" (Showtime, 1990). He found work in epics on both the big and small screen, playing the naÃ¯ve younger brother of Brad Pitt in ""Legends of the Fall"" (1994), and as Ishmael, sole-survivor of Ahab's ill-fated quest for revenge in the miniseries ""Moby Dick"" (USA, 1998). While his supporting role in ""All the Pretty Horses"" (2000) may not have led to a hit film, his turn in Martin Scorsese's violent ""Gangs of New York"" (2002) helped move Thomas past the limitations of forever being Elliot from ""E.T."" Guest turns on television series, such as ""Without a Trace"" (CBS, 2002-09), and supporting roles in major feature films like the romantic melodrama ""Dear John"" (2010), maintained a consistently visible profile for the working actor.

Her down-to-earth appeal also led to popularity in empowerment-themed chick flicks, ranging from the melodramatic ""Boys on the Side"" (1995) to the sublimely fun ""Charlie's Angels"" film franchise, which she also produced as co-owner of her own Flower Films.

Having made a number of modern classics, going all the way back to 1975's ""Jaws,"" Spielberg was universally regarded by both his peers and film historians as one of the greatest American filmmakers in the history of the medium. Born in Cincinnati and raised primarily in Phoenix, Arizona, Spielberg began making super 8 shorts films when he was still in his teens. At 16 he made his first feature length film, the science fiction adventure film ""Firelight"" (1963), which would later serve as the inspiration for his future masterwork ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977). Wanting to do nothing else with his life but make movies, Spielberg left Arizona at 18 to attend film school in Los Angeles. He was denied entry into the prominent film program at USC due to his C average, so Spielberg applied to and was admitted into California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). Spielberg dropped out of CSULB after a year, however, after he was signed to a 7-year TV directing contract with Universal based on the strength of his short film ""Amblin'"" (1968). Spielberg directed a number of television shows while under contract at Universal, but it was his 1971 made-for-TV road thriller ""Duel"" that proved to be the break he needed to make the leap into movies. After the success of ""Duel,"" Spielberg directed the critically acclaimed crime drama ""Sugarland Express"" (1974), which starred Goldie Hawn. It was his next film about a renegade great white shark off the coast of a New England resort town that would make the phrase ""blockbuster"" practically synonymous with Spielberg's name. Released in the summer of 1975, ""Jaws,"" which was made for $9 million dollars, grossed over $470 million at the box office, making it one of the most financially successful films ever, up until that point. The film was also nominated for Best Picture and took home three Academy Awards. For Spielberg, the massive success of ""Jaws"" would prove to be just the start of one of the most charmed filmmaking careers in Hollywood history. Over the next several decades he directed a wide array of universally beloved films that are now considered modern classics. These films include, but are not limited to: ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981), ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982), ""Schindler's List"" (1993), ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), ""Minority Report"" (2002), and ""Lincoln"" (2012). In addition to directing, Spielberg was also a prolific producer. Throughout his six decades in show business, Spielberg produced over 150 film and television projects. Furthermore, he's also taken home three Academy Awards, and has received scores of other nominations for his film and television work. In 2018 Spielberg directed his 32nd feature length film, ""Ready Player One."" The film was an adaption of a popular 2011 science fiction novel by Ernest Cline, and was well-received by both critics and audiences."
1202,Melissa Mathison,6/3/1950,"Los Angeles, California, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/-5EicRJgTo2GlsOWZeKp8aiGaIg=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/79226_v9_ba.jpg,"The sporadic but brilliant career of screenwriter Melissa Mathison offered a vivid case study of an artist who succeeded in maximizing the benefits of each opportunity she was afforded. Though she had only a half dozen films to her credit when she died of cancer on November 4, 2015, Mathison earned a permanent place in American pop culture as the writer of ""E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982). With its 1994 selection for inclusion in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, the film was officially certified a classic. Clearly this would have been an enviable credit for the most seasoned screenwriter; for a relative neophyte (""E.T."" was Mathison's first sole screenwriting credit and her first original screenplay), it was something of a miracle. The daughter of a journalist father and part-time publicist mother, Mathison grew up in the Hollywood Hills. Producer-writer-director Francis Ford Coppola was a family friend for whose children she baby-sat as a youth. The young Mathison also worked as a stringer for TIME magazine. She took time off from pursuing a degree in political science at the University of California at Berkeley to work for Coppola as an assistant on ""The Godfather, Part II"" (1974). By the time of Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), Mathison was credited as executive assistant. The celebrated filmmaker urged her to try her hand at screenwriting. The result was ""The Black Stallion"" (1979), based on Walter Farley's classic children's novel about a boy and his horse, which she co-scripted with two other writers. The film won kudos for both its sensitive adaptation and supremely cinematic storytelling. Mathison was dating Harrison Ford when he traveled on location to film ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981). During this arduous shoot, director Steven Spielberg approached her about writing a screenplay dealing with a little alien who gets stranded on Earth. Eight weeks later she had completed the first draft of ""E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial."" Mathison and Ford wed the March after ""E.T."" opened. She spent most of the next decade or so as a homemaker, with a brief excursion to TV to script ""Son of the Morning Star"" (ABC, 1991), a miniseries biopic about General George Custer starring Gary Cole. Mathison returned to feature screenwriting after a 13-year hiatus to adapt Lynne Reid Banks' children's novel ""The Indian in the Cupboard"" (1995). The project reunited her with ""E.T."" producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall as well as some of the stylistic and thematic hallmarks of that earlier triumph. Mathison was a natural choice to pen the story of a young boy who discovers that his wooden cabinet has the magical power to bring his toys to life. He learns about another culture and the dignity of all living things after placing a plastic Indian inside. Once again, Mathison revealed a sharp ear for how children speak and a dedication to grounding the fantastic elements of her story in a realistic context. ""The Indian in the Cupboard"" opened to solid reviews but modest box office. Mathison followed up with a project for producer-director Martin Scorsese, scripting ""Kundun"" (1997) a biopic of his holiness Tenzingyatso, the 14th Dalai Lamai of Tibet, who was forced into exile in 1959, nine years after the Chinese invasion. ""Kundun"" proved to be her final screen project until ""The BFG"" (2016), an adaptation of the novel by Roald Dahl. Melissa Mathison died of neuroendocrine cancer in Los Angeles on November 4, 2015. She was 65 years old."

After studying stage lighting and working in camera stores and photo labs, he began working on student films and as a professional photographer. In the mid-1960s, Daviau shot promotional films for recording artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin and The Who and was a still photographer for The Monkees. In 1967, he was introduced to aspiring filmmaker Steven Spielberg who eventually chose him to shoot the well-received short ""Amblin'"" (1969). Daviau began to find work as a cinematographer on TV-movies like ""The Streets of L.A."" (CBS, 1979) and ""Rage"" (NBC, 1990) before earning his first feature credit, for additional photography, on the special edition of Spielberg's ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (released in 1980). Considered one of the masters of the Hollywood film of the past two decades, Daviau has a knack not only just for crisp, energetic images that seem to jump off the screen, but also for lighting which delves into the psychological thought processes of the characters. He has been able to capture internal thoughts of characters which some film purists think was more easily done in black and white, not color. In that sense, Daviau may be considered a master of color filmmaking. He has shot several films from the point of view of a small child (""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" 1982; ""Empire of the Sun"" 1987; ""Avalon"" 1990). His work creates very specific worlds: a placid suburbia visited by a space creature in ""E.T.""; the grubby backstreets of China and the bleached out Japanese internment camp in ""Empire of the Sun""; the gauzy afterlife of Albert Brooks' ""Defending Your Life"" (1991); and the burgeoning world of Las Vegas in ""Bugsy"" (also 1991). For ""The Color Purple"" (1985), Daviau created a rich saturation of colors that blend so that the land and foliage become the people become the sky. Despite earning Oscar nominations for Best Cinematography for ""E.T."" ""The Color Purple,"" ""Empire of the Sun,"" ""Avalon"" and ""Bugsy,"" he has yet to win the award. He has continued to work into the 90s earning further praise for his work on Peter Weir's ""Fearless"" (1993) and Frank Marshall's ""Congo"" (1995). Allen Daviau died on April 15, 2020 in Los Angeles, CA at the age of 77."

Early in his career, Gabin earned fame on the stage with an imitation of Maurice Chevalier, which in retrospect, seemed an almost foregone conclusion, as both men embodied opposing sides of the French male persona as seen through the filter of motion pictures: Chevalier the charming bon vivant, and Gabin the brooding, lustful and reckless anti-hero. Both performers continued to personify those archetypes in their later years, but Gabin brought profound emotional depth to his lions in winter. The sins of the past were never far from his characters, which were often forced to violently confront their histories as they returned to bedevil their present lives. A treasured figure in the history of French cinema, Jean Gabin set the bar for leading men in his native country and elsewhere for generations."

Born Julien Victor in Paris at the end of the 19th century, he worked in a variety of odd jobs before finally discovering his true calling as an entertainer. Like many of his peers in those days, his work in music halls and small theaters lead to him breaking into film. His first full-length feature appearance was in 1931's ""American Love,"" and apparently he made quite an impression because he never wanted for movie work after that. With his strong presence and pronounced Paris accent, Carette was easy to cast in roguish or comic roles in movies set in the French capital or as distinctly Parisian characters. Perhaps the highest-profile work the actor appeared in was Jean Renoir's classic anti-war movie ""Grand Illusion""(1937). The film, which spotlighted Carette in a small but showy part as a brash actor, was the first foreign work to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. That appearance very much pleased his director, and Carette played roles in many of Renoir's subsequent films. These include the French Revolution period drama ""Le Marseillaise"" (1938) and the classic 1939 high society satire ""The Rules of the Game."""

His early years involved living a mostly extravagant life thanks to the mainstream success of his father the painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. When he came of age, he served in the French military in World War I and when he returned from the war, he tried to figure out the next phase of his life. That turned out to be film. In 1924, he wrote and directed his debut - the silent film ""Backbiters"" (1924). It wasn't all that successful, but Renoir kept working on his craft. Over the next decade, he kept making films, including his first work with sound, ""On Purge Bebe"" (1931), an adaptation of ""Madame Bovary"" (1934), and the ahead-of-its-time ""The Crime of Monsieur Lange"" (1936). Renoir's work broke into the international scene with the war drama ""La Grande Illusion"" (1937), which netted him notoriety in Hollywood. He continued to make movies in Europe until World War II began and he left to make his way to California. ""Swamp Water"" (1941) was his first American film, though it wasn't as well received. Over the years, he grew more comfortable making films in the States, critically peaking with ""The Southerner"" (1945), which earned an Oscar nomination for Best Director. In 1951, Renoir began to dabble in color, making ""The River"" (1951), ""The Golden Coach"" (1953), ""Elena and Her Men"" (1956), and many more. His last directorial effort was a trio of short films that were compiled into ""The Little Theatre of Jean Renoir"" (1969). In 1975, he received a lifetime achievement award at the Academy Awards. He passed away following a heart attack in 1979 at the age of 84."

Adams grew up in a big family (she was the fourth of seven siblings) and due to her father's career in the United States Army, she moved around a lot as a child. She was born on a military complex in Italy, and continued moving with her parents and siblings from one Army base to the next throughout the early part of her childhood. When she was 8 years-old, Amy's parents finally put some permanent roots down in Castle Rock, Colorado. It was around this time that Adams first discovered her love for performing. She described her family as not having a lot of money, so to entertain themselves they would often put on skits. Amy was always cast as the lead, and quickly found that she loved acting in front of an audience. When she entered high school, Adams, who was never a good student, started training as a ballerina. She had aspirations of going pro, but by the time she graduated at 18, Adams realized that a professional ballerina career was not in the cards. After high school ended, Adams moved to Atlanta, Georgia with her mother. It was there that she renewed her childhood passion for acting by getting involved in community theater. One of her first productions during this period was a part in a local production of the musical ""Annie."" The rush of energy she received from being on stage was enough to convince Adams that she had found her life's calling. From there, she began taking on more roles in community theater. By the mid-1990s Adams was doing dinner theater in places like Boulder, Colorado and Chanhassen, Minnesota, which allowed her to hone her craft night after night. It was also during this period that Adams worked waitressing jobs to make some extra cash. Then in the late 90s, when she was living in Minnesota, Adams went to a local audition for a new film called ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"" (1999). The film was a satire on beauty pageants, and starred Kristen Dunst and Kirstie Alley. After auditioning for the role, Adams was cast in a supporting role as an over-sexed cheerleader named Leslie Miller. After landing the part in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" Adams moved to Los Angeles where she began auditioning for whatever roles came her way. She nabbed guest spots on TV shows like ""That 70s Show"" (Fox, 1998-2006) and ""Smallville"" (The WB/The CW, 2001-2011), as well as a substantial part in the Steven Spielberg film ""Catch Me if You Can"" (2002). After a few years in L.A., however, Adams was growing frustrated and was seriously contemplating quitting acting for good. With her career prospects looking grim, Adams decided to take a chance by accepting a role in an independent comedy-drama called ""Junebug."" Adams felt an instant connection with her character, a chatty pregnant woman named Ashley Johnsten, and her performance earned her heaps of critical praise. As a result, Adams was nominated for her first acting Oscar for ""Junebug."" With her stock on the rise after the huge success of ""Junebug,"" Adams started getting offers to play the kind of roles she always wanted to play. And over the next several years, she would win over critics and audiences alike for her sterling performances in films like ""Enchanted"" (2007), ""Doubt,"" ""The Fighter"" (2010), and ""The Master."" In 2013 Adams begin playing the fictional Lois Lane, the love interest of Superman, in the superhero film ""Man of Steel"" (2013). It was a role she would reprise in two additional superhero films: ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) and ""Justice League"" (2017). By the late 2010s, Adams's career showed no signs of slowing down. She earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for her role in ""Sharp Objects"" (HBO, 2018), which was based on a novel by Gillian Flynn, and also played Lynne Cheney, the wife of the former Vice President Dick Cheney, in Adam McKay's comedy biopic ""Vice"" (2018). Her role as Cheney earned Adams her sixth Oscar nomination, thus lending even more credence to Amy Adam's already defined status as one of the most celebrated actresses of her generation."

A prolific director able to work in a wide variety of genres, Villeneuve was one of Francophone Canada's most compelling auteurs of his generation. Born in the southern Quebec suburb of Gentilly on October 3, 1967, Villeneuve was initially interested in science before he abandoned the laboratory and decided to pursue his love of movies. He studied film at the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  MontrÃ©al and began his film career in his early twenties when he was credited as director for the television documentary ""La course destination monde"" (1988). Two years later, he entered Radio-Canada's youth film competition ""La Course Europe-Asie"" in 1990 and won. These early successes allowed him to earnestly pursue more film projects, albeit small, low-budget productions. Without any studio support, Villeneuve wrote and directed a short film titled ""REW-FFD"" (1994), followed by an anthology of six short films, ""Cosmos"" (1996), in which he directed the segment titled ""Le Technetium."" With a couple of short films under his belt, Villeneuve next tackled a feature. Written and directed by himself, ""Un 32 aoÃ»t sur terre"" (1998) was screened at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, where it was received positively. Villeneuve's next full-length feature, ""MaelstrÃ¶m"" (2000), built upon his previous success and showed off his burgeoning talents. Once again written and directed by Villeneuve himself, ""MaelstrÃ¶m"" was a drama about a depressed, alcoholic woman who falls in love with the son of a man whom she accidentally killed in a hit-and-run. The film was widely praised on the international film festival circuit, winning directorial awards for Villeneuve from the Vancouver Film Critics Circle and the Toronto International Film Festival. ""MaelstrÃ¶m"" was also recognized several times at the Genie Awards -- Canada's equivalent to the Academy Awards -- including wins for Best Motion Picture and Best Director for Villeneuve. Nearly a decade later, the writer-director returned with the tense hostage drama ""Polytechnique"" (2009), based on a mass shooting that took place at a Montreal college in 1989. The Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television deemed ""Polytechnique"" the best Canadian film of the year, sweeping seven of the major awards at the 30th Genie Awards, including Villeneuve's second Best Director award. Unlike the long gap between Villeneuve's first and second features, he returned the following year with the sibling drama ""Incendies."" Once again, he claimed the Best Director Genie award, for the second consecutive year, but the film was also recognized internationally, including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film several more festival awards. With his international profile at its highest point yet, Villeneuve made a pair of films in quick succession, both featuring Hollywood star Jake Gyllenhaal. ""Enemy"" (2013) was an erotic thriller based on Portuguese author Jose Saramago's novel The Double. The more high-profile ""Prisoners"" (2013) was an American-backed film co-starring Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard as a pair of suburban neighbors whose daughters are abducted and Gyllenhaal as the detective investigating their disappearance. Both ""Prisoners"" and ""Enemy"" premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. His next film, drug war thriller ""Sicario"" (2015) was a major critical success that raised Villeneuve's American profile considerably. That led to his first major American studio film, the philosophical alien invasion story ""Arrival"" (2016) starring Amy Adams as a linguist attempting to communicate with aliens making first contact with Earth. The film scored eight Academy award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, but won only for Best Sound Editing. Villeneuve immediately capitalized on the film's success by helming science fiction reboot ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), which opened to uniformly rapturous reviews from both professional critics and social media tastemakers, and developing a new version of cult SF favorite ""Dune."""

Although Heisserer never intended on making his living as a screenwriter, you might say that a professional writing career was in his blood. His mother worked as an editor for a publishing company, while his father worked as a writer and professor of ancient history. For Eric Heisserer, however, his introduction into the writing world came when he took a position writing narratives for video games. Heisserer worked in the video games industry for a number of years, and mostly enjoyed the work. However, on one such occasion he turned in a video game script that was rejected on account of that fact that it was, as Heisserer later recalled, ""too linear, like a movie."" This initial rejection was the impetus that launched Heisserer into the world of screenwriting. Admittedly, his first few screenplays were awful, but the more he honed his craft, the better the writing became. He sold his first script to Warner Bros. in 2005, and had his first screenplay produced in 2010 with ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" - a reboot of the classic 80s horror film. Heisserer had two more screenplays produced the following year with ""Final Destination 5"" (2011) and ""The Thing"" (2011), both of which were horror films. Heisserer made his directorial debut in 2013 with ""Hours,"" which he also wrote. The film was notable for being released shortly after the tragic death of its star Paul Walker. For his next big writing project Heisserer was asked to adapt a shorty story called ""Story of Your Life"" written by the acclaimed science-fiction writer Ted Chiang. After working on multiple versions of the script, which was renamed to ""Arrival,"" the film premiered to rave reviews in November of 2016. Heisserer's script was primarily singled out by critics for its high level of depth and craftsmanship. As a result, when Oscar nominations were announced in early 2017, Heisserer received a nod for his ""Arrival"" screenplay, while the film received eight Academy Award nominations in total. It was Heisserer's first Oscar nomination."

The Canadian-born Levy broke into show business in the late 1980s as an actor with occasional television guest star roles, but would go on to make a bigger name producing and directing light kiddie fare, including stewarding the Disney Channel hit, ""The Famous Jett Jackson"" (1998-2001), before eventually graduating to network primetime as executive producer of the short-lived Rebecca Romjin series, ""Pepper Dennis"" (2006). In the meantime, he developed a rep as a workmanlike helmsman of family films, often working in tandem with producer Robert Simonds on films like the two Steve Martin vehicles, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (2003) and ""The Pink Panther"" (2006). Though never a critical darling, Levy watched the box-office receipts of his movies increasingly outweigh his less auspicious notices; most markedly with the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise, which collectively went on to gross nearly $1 billion at the worldwide box office. By the end of the millennium's first decade, Levy had made a name for himself as a staple creator of Hollywood's lighter blockbuster fare, commanding some of the top budgets for comedic productions in the business."

Low key yet persistent and haunting, Johansson's work - much of it done for film and television scores - added a new and striking dimension to neo-classical composition, that seemed inseparable from the cultural mythos of the country that produced it. Born in 1969, JÃ³hannsson took his debut bow in his early 30s, when his album EnglabÃ¶rn (Angel Children) was recorded at FrÃ­kirkjan and NT&V Studios in August 2001 and released on the Touch label the following October. A 48-minute piece of chamber music authored for string quartet, piano, percussion, glockenspiel and electronic instruments - which Johansson both performed and arranged - it announced its creator as a formidable talent. It also revealed the diversity of his inspirations, demonstrating influence by a variegated spectrum of artists from Moondog to Erik Satie. Successive JÃ³hannsson albums appeared to unabated acclaim, including the brass ensemble piece Virthulegu Forsetar (2004) and the orchestral recording 12 TÃ³nar (2004). Yet by JÃ³hannsson's quaternary release, the 2006 IBM, A User's Manual - an album comprised of sounds from an old IBM mainframe computer - it became clear to everyone that the musician was aggressively stretching himself, eager to try undreamt of innovations in the studio. In time, JÃ³hannsson began to receive his broadest pop culture recognition for his film and television compositions, an interest that he carried from the outset of his career.  Unsurprisingly, given the offbeat nature of his work, it almost exclusively accompanied arthouse features in lieu of Hollywood films. Motion pictures fully or partially scored by JÃ³hannsson include: Paul McGuigan's 2004 romantic mystery ""Wicker Park,"" So Yong Kim's harrowing divorce drama ""For Ellen"" (2012), Josh C. Waller's crime saga ""McCanick"" (2013), and - most visibly - James Marsh's 2014 Stephen Hawking biopic ""The Theory of Everything."" For that project, JÃ³hannsson received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score in early 2015."

Born Eugene Curran Kelly in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on August 23, 1912, Kelly's initial dream was to play shortstop for his hometown baseball team, the Pirates, and he was dismayed when his mother enrolled him and his brother, James, in dance classes. He quit after being bullied by neighborhood toughs, and resumed his focus on sports until high school, when he found that he could earn money in local dance contests and through teaching dance at his family's studio, which opened in 1931. The studio provided him and his family with support during his undergraduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh, where he pursued a degree in economics; Kelly might have gone on to become a lawyer had the family's school not proven so successful, prompting him to move to New York and try his hand at acting in New York. His first attempt, in 1937, yielded no jobs, so Kelly returned to Pittsburgh, where he choreographed and performed in a production of ""Hold Your Hats"" the following year. After seeing his work in Pittsburgh, dancer and choreographer Robert Alton invited Kelly to perform in the Broadway run of Cole Porter's ""Leave It To Me!"" This led to his own choreography and dancing in 1939's ""The Time of Your Life"" and ""Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshow"" (1939), where he met and married fellow cast member Betsy Blair, and finally, top billing in Rodgers and Hart's ""Pal Joey"" in 1940. A graceful but unquestionably athletic dancer who also possessed a capable singing voice, comic timing and movie star charisma, it was inevitable that Hollywood would come calling, and after signing with David O. Selznick in 1941, he was loaned out to MGM for his first feature, ""For Me and My Gal"" (1942), which starred Judy Garland. A box office success, it led to supporting roles in ""Christmas Holiday"" (1944) and his first lead, opposite Lucille Ball, in ""Du Barry Was a Lady"" (1943), which was soon followed by his first screen choreography assignment in ""Thousands Cheer"" (1943), where his humorous routine with a mop drew critical praise. But with his next picture - a loan-out to Columbia for ""Cover Girl"" (1944) with Rita Hayworth - Kelly established himself as a new and innovative force in screen dance and musicals, one that hinged equally on technique and skill as it did on visual effects and cinematography. In ""Cover Girl,"" Kelly, in collaboration with choreographer Stanley Donen, created indelible dance routines - using superimposition to suggest Kelly dancing with himself in the ""Alter Ego"" sequence - and would top these efforts with his next picture, ""Anchors Away"" (1945), which found him dancing opposite MGM's cartoon star Jerry Mouse. Both films were huge hits, and ""Anchors"" earned Kelly an Oscar nod for Best Actor; by the following year, his status was such that he was partnered with the reigning king of screen dance, Fred Astaire, to perform and collaborate on a route for ""Ziegfield Follies"" (1946). Recognizing that they had an assured box office draw in Kelly, MGM kept him in regular rotation as an actor/dancer and choreographer for its musicals, including ""The Pirate"" (1952) with reunited him with Garland, and two successful team-ups with Frank Sinatra in ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" (1949) and the Oscar-winning ""On the Town"" (1949), which brought the screen musical out of the soundstage in and into real-life locations like the streets of New York City. Despite these laurels, Kelly wanted to direct his own vision of a Hollywood musical, and in 1951, he earned the chance with ""An American in Paris."" A stunning, Impressionistic effort that crystallized his style of dance - a combination of ballet, tap and modern dance captured in fluid, always moving camerawork and editing - ""Paris,"" which featured a 17-minute dream ballet sequence, won six Oscars, including Best Picture and an honorary Oscar to Kelly for his contributions to musicals and choreography. Its reputation as Kelly's best film effort has been largely eclipsed by its follow-up, the effervescent ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952), the most streamlined union of comedy, music and romance conceived by Kelly and co-director Donen, and featuring what is arguably one of the most iconic screen moments in the title sequence. But the film was not as successful with critics and audiences as its predecessor, and it would mark the beginning of the end of Kelly's tenure with MGM and as its leading purveyor of screen musicals. Audiences' interests in musicals had begun to wane, and Kelly's efforts were growing increasingly more artistic in their scope: the ballet-fueled ""Invitation to the Dance"" (1956) was an expensive flop, and ""Brigadoon"" (1954) and ""It's Always Fair Weather"" (1956) were hampered by studio interference and disinterest. He would complete one last musical for MGM, ""Les Girls"" (1957), before focusing his attention behind the camera. He could still be called upon to appear on screen - most notably in a dramatic turn as acerbic reporter Hornbeck in the 1960 film version of ""Inherit the Wind,"" and he was memorable in Jacques Demy's ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"" (1967), which paid tribute to Kelly's MGM work - but he found more rewarding work as a producer/director for television. He earned an Emmy nomination for a 1958 episode of ""Omnibus"" (CBS/NBC/ABC, 1952-1961) in which he worked with sports greats like Mickey Mantle and Sugar Ray Robinson, and won the Emmy for Outstanding Children's Programming with a 1967 production of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" which, like ""Anchors Aweigh,"" skillfully integrated live action and animation. One of his biggest theatrical successes of the period was a comedy, ""A Guide for the Married Man"" (1967), which gave Kelly the clout to direct a film version of ""Hello, Dolly!"" (1969). Though popular, and the recipient of three Oscars, the film was so expensive that it failed to recoup its massive costs. Kelly's final projects were a mixed bag - the Western comedy ""The Cheyenne Social Club"" (1970) was a flop, but his participation in the MGM compilation film ""That's Entertainment!"" (1974), which included several song and dance duets with a 77-year-old Fred Astaire, received glowing reviews. He would appear in a handful of features and television episodes, most of which hinged on his screen image - the surreal musical ""Xanadu"" (1980) showed that he could still carry out dance sequences - and numerous tributes, including Kennedy Center Honors in 1982.  a Health issues, including a stroke in 1994, would bring to a close his storied career, and after a second stroke in 1995 left him impaired, Kelly would die in his home in Beverly Hills, California, on February 2, 1996 at the age of 83. Quincy Jones paid tribute to Kelly at the Academy Awards that year with Savion Glover's rendition of Kelly's dance from ""Singin' in the Rain."""

One of a long line of girls-next-door like Doris Day and June Allyson, Reynolds was never as sultry as Day could be, and was less of a tomboy than either. In her most successful films, like ""Tammy and the Bachelor"" (1957) and ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952), she was often cast as a sincere young adult in the throes of puppy love rather than the virgin chased by rogues like Day or the placid housewife like Allyson. Her squeaky-clean image came in handy when, in the biggest Hollywood scandal of the 1950s, her then-husband Eddie Fisher left her and their two children, Carrie and Todd, for sultry screen goddess, Elizabeth Taylor. Not surprisingly, the public was more than on Reynolds' side as the jilted wife. Once that furor died down, Reynolds was left to reinvent herself. In the late 1960s, when new sexual mores suddenly rendered the docile suburban female image a thing of the past, Reynolds shifted her focus to nightclub and theatrical stages. She was absent from the big screen for decades but settled into a comfortable presence in the American fabric by returning to film in the 1990s with funny mom roles in films like ""Mother"" (1996) and ""In and Out"" (1997), hysterical guest appearances as the over-the-top mother of Grace Adler (Debra Messing) on ""Will & Grace"" (NBC, 1998-2006), and a clever turn as Frances Liberace in Steven Soderbergh's biopic ""Behind the Candelabra"" (HBO 2013). Reynolds brought both self-deprecating wit and nostalgic charm to these and other well-received comedic outings, using her persona as a perennially perky throwback to mine genuine laughs into her 80s. Tragically, Debbie Reynolds died on December 28, 2016, only one day after the death of her daughter Carrie Fisher. She was 84 years old."

His amazing acrobatics, winning personality and incredible comedic timing were quickly noticed by Hollywood and he was featured in a series of B-pictures from the late 1930s through the 1940s, including ""Sing, You Sinners"" (1938) with Bing Crosby and Fred MacMurray, and the popular talking mule comedy ""Francis"" (1949). However, it was the MGM masterpiece ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952) that finally gave O'Connor a first class vehicle for his skills. Even decades after its release, the performer's instantly famous ""Make 'em Laugh!"" song and dance number remained a knockout. Further assignments in major musicals like ""Call Me Madam"" (1953) and ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" (1954), as well as numerous turns on television variety programs and in stage shows gained him a well deserved following. His abilities were so well known that when gigs in movies or on television were not available to O'Connor, he could easily find work on stage or as a top flight Las Vegas performer. Although O'Connor's career in later years was temporarily derailed by health issues, his incredible smile, winning personality and seemingly boundless energy stayed with him throughout the decades and his best work ranked among the most exhilarating to be found in the golden age of Hollywood musicals."

But Hagen did manage to grace a number of other instantly recognizable movie titles during her 30-year run. She started out in the 1949 Tracy-Hepburn comedy ""Adam's Rib,"" segued to John Huston's 1950 noir ""The Asphalt Jungle,"" and worked alongside the Oscar-nominated Greer Garson in the FDR drama ""Sunrise at Campobello."" Hagen made a nice transition to TV with the long-running role of Margaret Williams on ""The Danny Thomas Show,"" appearing in 89 episodes from 1953 to 1956.

During this time, he appeared onstage with such future movie luminaries as James Cagney and Joan Blondell, and like those stars he soon won roles in Hollywood. His first film characters weren't particularly auspicious--he played a secretary in a short called ""What Price Pants"" in 1931, and in his next effort, the feature ""Secrets of a Secretary,"" he graduated to the role of drunk. But more complex characters lay ahead. In 1942, Mitchell appeared as a detective in the comedic mystery ""Mr. and Mrs. North,"" starring popular comedian Gracie Allen, and repeated the role several years later in an early attempt at a TV movie adaptation. More prominently, the actor had a high-profile part as a major general in the Oscar-winning World War II bomber-pilot saga ""Twelve O'Clock High.""

By the '50s, he was alternating between movies and television series, and one in particular, the musical ""Singin' in the Rain,"" allowed him to branch out from playing a sleaze to a motion picture director.

She suffered from polio as a young girl and took up dancing as part of her recovery. As a teenager, she was sent to California for professional dance training and landed in the touring troupe of the Ballet Russe Monte Carlo, where she met her first husband, Nico Charisse. After a couple of anonymous background dancing roles, Charisse appeared earned her first credit in ""Something to Talk About"" (1943) using the name Lily Norwood. She landed a contract at MGM and producer Arthur Freed changed her name to Cyd Charisse for her appearance in ""Zeigfeld Follies"" (1945), directed by Vincente Minelli. Freed cast Charisse again in ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952), this time in a single dance scene with Gene Kelly, but it was enough to make her the leading lady in her next film, ""The Band Wagon"" (1953) with Fred Astaire, again produced by Freed and directed by Minelli.

With dancing on the wane, Charisse began to take more dramatic roles. Starting with ""Party Girl"" (1958), she began to escape the dance genre, and for the next decade appeared in supporting roles in films like ""Assassination in Rome"" (1965) and ""The Silencers"" (1966), as well as guest roles on shows like ""Fantasy Island"" (ABC, 1977-1984) and ""Murder, She Wrote"" (CBS, 1984-1996).

Donen began taking dance lessons as a child, and dance would remain his greatest passion, even as he enrolled at the University of South Carolina as a psychology major. He only lasted a single semester however, before, with his family's encouragement, he moved to New York to try his luck as a professional dancer. Donen landed his first role in the chorus of the original production of Rodgers and Hart's ""Pal Joey"" in 1940, where he first met longtime friend and collaborator Gene Kelly. The pair would work together on a number of Broadway plays, often with Donen acting as assistant choreographer. Eventually, when Kelly made the move to film, Donen did the same, making his debut in and assistant choreographing ""Best Foot Forward"" (1943). Before long, Donen and Kelly reconnected and began collaborating on the choreography for major movie musicals like ""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945). Donen eventually paired with Kelly again to not only co-choreograph but co-direct ""On the Town"" (1949). With his reputation as a bankable director in the difficult genre of musicals fully cemented, he went on to direct his own childhood idol Fred Astaire in ""Royal Wedding"" (1951) before reteaming with Kelly to co-direct the classic ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952). Donen would go on to direct a number of both musical and non-musical hits like ""Funny Face"" (1957), ""Charade"" (1963), and ""Two for the Road"" (1967), not to mention the science fiction film ""Saturn 3"" (1980). Donen would direct his last feature film, frothy sex comedy ""Blame it on Rio"" (1984) in 1984, and henceforth largely returned to theater, memorably directing a production of ""The Red Shoes"" in 1993.

She and Green began their collaboration in 1939 when they formed (with Judy Holliday) ""The Revuers,"" a cabaret act. Their success in such venues as the Village Vanguard and the Blue Angel led to several TV appearances as well. In 1944, Comden and Green wrote their first stage musical, ""On the Town,"" adapted from a Jerome Robbins' ballet that traced one day in the life of three sailors on leave in NYC. They subsequently provided the lyrics (for composers ranging from Leonard Bernstein to Jule Styne to Cy Coleman), book or both for ""Wonderful Town"" (1953), ""Bells Are Ringing"" (1957), written especially for Judy Holliday, ""Do Re Mi"" (1960), ""Hallelujah Baby!"" (1967), ""Applause"" (1970), ""On the Twentieth Century"" (1978), ""A Doll's Life"" (1982) and ""The Will Rogers Follies"" (1991). Many of their memorable songs from these shows have become minor classics, like ""Ohio"" from ""Wonderful Town,"" ""The Party's Over"" from ""Bells Are Ringing"" and ""Make Someone Happy"" from ""Do Re Mi."" Comden and Green segued to the big screen with their screenplay for the remake of the 20s hit ""Good News"" (1947). The pair also wrote the witty musical ""The Barkleys of Broadway"" (1949), which brought Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers together after ten years. The same year, they provide lyrics for the Gene Kelly vehicle ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame."" In 1952, they provided the brilliant structure for what many consider to be the greatest movie musical, ""Singin' in the Rain."" The following year, Comden and Green adapted the stage musical ""The Band Wagon"" and provided Astaire with one of his best screen roles. The duo adapted their own ""Bells Are Ringing"" (1960) and wrote the non-musical screenplay for ""Auntie Mame"" (1958). Comden has sporadically worked as a performer. On stage, she was featured in ""On the Town"" and she and Green won kudos for their revue ""A Party With Betty Comden and Adolph Green"" (first performed in 1957), a collection of sketches and songs. Comden turned in a fine comic portrayal of a Jewish mother in Wendy Wasserstein's off-Broadway hit, ""Isn't It Romantic"" (1984- 85). On film, the petite, dark-haired, throaty-voiced Comden was featured in ""Greenwich Village"" (1944), played the reclusive screen legend in ""Garbo Talks"" (1984) and appeared in James Ivory's ""Slaves of New York"" (1989)."

Showered with awards and nominations, they wrote the screenplays for the film hits ""Singin' in the Rain"" (1952), ""The Band Wagon"" (1953), ""It's Always Fair Weather"" (1955), ""Bells Are Ringing"" (1960), which was based on their musical, and ""Auntie Mame"" (1958). Seven-time Tony-winners, they penned such classic Broadway hits as ""Wonderful Town,"" ""Peter Pan"" and ""Applause.""

Born and raised in the historic city of Norwich, England, Colman was inspired by her mother, who pursued ballet dancing as a young woman, to embark on a career in the arts. With that in mind, Colman decided to translate her love of performers and performing into the pursuit of a professional acting career. She started young, and by her mid-teens Colman was nabbing lead roles in school plays. When it came time to enter college, Colman briefly put her acting aspirations on hold to study primary teaching at Homerton College in Cambridge. However, her time at the college would prove to be short-lived. Colman wanted to be an actress after all, so she left Homerton and began studying drama at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. After graduating from the school in 1999, Colman began working almost immediately. She started out appearing primarily on television, with supporting roles on shows like ""Mr. Charity"" (BBC, 2001) and ""Holby City"" (BBC, 1999- ). Her first big break in the UK came in 2003 when she began playing Sophie Chapman on the comedy series ""Peep Show"" (Channel 4, 2003-2015). The success of her work on ""Peep Show"" led to additional roles on British comedy shows, including ""Green Wing"" (Channel 4, 2004-07), ""Beautiful People"" (BBC Two, 2008-09), and ""Fleabag"" (BBC, 2016- ). By the early 2010s Colman also began branching out by taking on various film roles. Her film roles included ""The Iron Lady"" (2011), ""I Give It a Year"" (2013), and ""The Lobster"" (2015), the last of which was directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. In 2016 Colman won accolades in America for her recurring role on the thriller mini-series ""The Night Manager"" (BBC One/AMC, 2016). ""The Night Manager"" was broadcast on both British and American television networks, and earned Colman a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. In 2018 Colman worked with Yorgos Lanthimos once again when she was cast as Queen Anne of Britain in the period comedy-drama ""The Favourite."" The film was nominated for 10 Oscars, with Colman taking home her first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2019 Colman began playing another Queen of England, Elizabeth II, on the Netflix historical drama series ""The Crown.""

Predictions of her bright future bore fruit when Weisz's stunning portrayal of an activist murdered under mysterious circumstances in the heartrending drama ""The Constant Gardner"" (2005) won her Oscar, Golden Globe, and SAG awards. She returned to screens the following year opposite Hugh Jackman in the metaphysical love story ""The Fountain"" (2006), directed by then-husband Darren Aronofsky.

A native of Scottsdale, Arizona, she began acting as a child in local theater productions around Phoenix. She moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to pursue acting full time and was cast as Laurie Partridge in ""The New Partridge Family"" (VH1, 2004), a failed reboot of the popular 1970s show. Guest roles in TV series such as ""Malcolm in the Middle"" (Fox, 2000-06) and ""Medium"" (NBC, 2005-11) followed before a supporting role in a raunchy comedy put her on the map.

She was soon cast as one of the leads in the short-lived action series ""Drive"" (Fox, 2007). The film roles started becoming bigger, including starring opposite Anna Faris in ""The House Bunny"" (2008) and joining Woody Harrelson, Abigail Breslin, and Jesse Eisenberg in the surprise hit ""Zombieland"" (2009) as post-apocalyptic con artist Wichita. The actress stepped up to carrying a film when she starred in Will Gluck's teen comedy ""Easy A"" (2010), playing a high school girl caught up in a series of rumors run rampant. After supporting roles in ""Crazy, Stupid Love"" (2011) and ""Friends With Benefits"" (2011), she jumped into prestige fare with a starring role in ""The Help"" (2011) as aspiring writer Skeeter Phelan. The film was a critical and commercial success and put Stone on a new, more adult, trajectory. The actress joined a long list of Woody Allen muses when she starred in the director's ""Magic in the Moonlight"" (2014) and ""Irrational Man"" (2015). She also became part of the popular superhero genre with her role as Gwen Stacy in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (2012) and ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (2014) with Andrew Garfield playing the web-slinger. The actress earned her first Academy Award nomination with her role as Michael Keaton's disaffected daughter in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Oscar-winner ""Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" (2014). Her role opposite Ryan Gosling, her costar in ""Crazy, Stupid Love,"" in Damien Chazelle's acclaimed musical ""La La Land"" (2016) cemented her status as an A-list actress. Displaying her musical talents as aspiring actress Mia, she won the Oscar for Best Actress. She continued her strong run, earning critical acclaim for playing real-life tennis star and LGBTQ icon Billie Jean King in ""Battle of the Sexes"" (2017) with Steve Carell. She next joined Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz in the period drama ""The Favourite"" (2018). Her role as scheming lady-in-waiting Abigail Masham scored the actress another Oscar nomination. Despite the critical acclaim, Stone gained a reputation for not taking herself too seriously, making self-effacing appearances on talk shows and the sketch comedy mainstay ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC, 1975- ). In between film roles, she joined former co-star Jonah Hill for the drama series ""Maniac"" (Netflix, 2018), playing a troubled young woman participating in an experimental drug trial. She returned to one of her earliest successes when she reteamed with Eisenberg, Breslin, and Harrelson for the sequel ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" (2019).

His first taste of popular success was winning the 1997 Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with his League of Gentlemen colleagues. Up until then he had done some TV writing on science fiction projects, and made a few acting appearances. The troupe's success led to ""The League of Gentlemen"" TV series in 1999, which ran until 2002. Its sketch comedy format featured absurd observational humor about British life and was a huge success. Gatiss has made numerous appearances in other TV series in England, including a co-starring role in the dark comedy ""Nighty Night""; the sci-fi comedy ""Clone""; and the 2005 reboot of the classic sci-fi series ""Doctor Who,"" for which the actor also contributed his writing talents. Indeed, Gatiss has written screenplays for the TV shows ""Crooked House,"" ""Agatha Christie: Poirot,"" and several TV movies. In 2010 the TV series ""Sherlock"" debuted, which he co-created. Gatiss has also written books about the film industry and ""Doctor Who"" novels."

Although there were very few Greek films being made, Lanthimos managed to find work behind the camera as a commercial director. He co-directed his first feature, a comedy called ""My Best Friend"" (2001), but the mainstream sensibility didn't suit his style. ""Kinetta"" (2005) was his first solo directing effort, and his unique style and framing earned the film entry into international festivals in Berlin and Toronto. His aesthetic was on full display in ""Dogtooth"" (2009), a drama about a family that has withdrawn from the outside world. The film earned the Un Certain Regard Award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Lanthimos' next film ""Alps"" (2011) wasn't met with the same regard, but his first English language film, ""The Lobster"" (2015), cemented his reputation as a wholly unique auteur. The film won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and Lanthimos was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His follow up, the thoughtful psychological thriller ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) starring Nicole Kidman didn't have as much success, but again Lanthimos bounced back with his most high profile project to date. ""The Favourite"" (2018) won the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director."

A handsome, affable presence, he made an ideal onscreen romantic partner to some of Hollywood's biggest female stars, including Claudette Colbert and Carole Lombard. So believable was MacMurray as upstanding young men that it seemed unlikely that he could play anything else, a notion that was dispelled by his chilly turn as a doomed murderer in Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" (1944).  He proved equally successful in portraying the dark flipside to the Everyman, seduced by the lure of power, prestige and sex in ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1953) and Wilder's ""The Apartment"" (1960), though by the early 1960s, his status as America's favorite father figure was essentially complete. And if his versatility was often overshadowed by the vast number of audience-friendly pictures to his name, Fred MacMurray remained one of the screen's most likable personalities for decades, even long after his death in 1991."

At times sultry and sweet; vulnerable and tough; comedic and dramatic; joyous and tragic - she simply was one of the greatest and most unique actresses during Hollywood's Golden Era. She could play whatever the part required, whether it was madcap glamour in comedies like ""The Lady Eve"" (1941), tough-minded feminism in weepies like ""Stella Dallas"" (1937), or poisonous vixens in noir classics like ""Double Indemnity"" (1944). A working-class girl from Brooklyn, she became one of the richest women in the United States due to wise investments. On a personal level, she was wildly popular among her peers, yet died a virtual recluse. Most astounding of all, she gave some of the most unforgettable performances in film history, yet never won an Academy Award for her work. Like many an aging glamour girl, she moved reluctantly into TV in the 1950s and 1960s when her movie career declined, but became an even bigger star than she had been before. Barbara Stanwyck - an American original and the true essence of the word ""dame"" - like no other actress of her generation enjoyed a long, varied career in film and television while remaining beloved by her millions of fans."

Robinson made a living as a ""tough guy"" in a raft of iterations, from hardboiled newspaperman to intrepid G-man.

Able to command the screen by both verve and subtlety, he played his roles with such archetypal distinction and verbal flare that he would wind up inspiring a number of cartoon characters, from the shorts of Warner Bros. studio-mate Bugs Bunny while he was alive to lovably inept constable Chief Wiggum in American television's longest-running show, ""The Simpsons"" (Fox, 1989- )."

Cain was one of its leading architects. His best novels, which included The Postman Always Rings Twice, Mildred Pierce and Double Indemnity, helped to establish the tenets of the style in both novel and film form through stories of outsiders and misfits whose interactions with each other, spurred largely through sex or greed, ultimately lead to their destruction. Cain's lean prose, which was fraught with lust and violence, became a favorite source for Hollywood noir, and some of the best films of the genre were based on his work, including the 1946 version of ""Postman,"" Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), and 1945's ""Mildred Pierce"" with Joan Crawford.

Born in Chicago, Chandler was raised in England by relatives after he and his mother were abandoned by his alcoholic father. After returning to the U.S and seeing horrific action as a soldier in World War I, he became a high-paid oil executive before publishing his first short story in Black Mask magazine. At the age of 50, he wrote his first novel, The Big Sleep, which was followed by such titles as Farewell, My Lovely and The Long Goodbye, each of which sold better than the one before. With success came the attentions of Hollywood, and although Chandler garnered Oscar nominations for his work on the noir classics, ""Double Indemnity"" (1944) and ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946), his time with the studios was far from fulfilling. Over the years, Marlowe was portrayed on screen by several of Hollywood's most popular leading men, among them Humphrey Bogart in ""The Big Sleep"" (1946), Elliot Gould in ""The Long Goodbye"" (1973) and Robert Mitchum in ""Farewell, My Lovely"" (1975). Though underappreciated during his lifetime, Chandler would later be revered for transforming the crime fiction genre into a prism through which the author eloquently cast his sardonic eye upon the state of America, its culture and people."

He played in ""The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer"" in 1947, as well as having a starring role in the film serial ""Hop Harrigan,"" before appearing with more frequency on TV. He had a role as Major Norton in the very popular Davy Crockett episodes of ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"" in the mid '50s and had guest roles on sitcoms like ""Hazel"" and ""Petticoat Junction"" in the '60s.

Within two years, he had graduated to camera operator and received a variety of assignments, including newsreels and shorts, particularly for Pathe. Always an innovator, Freund was experimenting with sound film as early as 1908, and also developed his own camera. In the 1920s, Freund worked at the UFA studios during what has become known as the Golden Age of German cinema. Collaborating with such film artists as Fritz Lang, F.W. Murnau, Paul Wegener and E.A. Dupont, Freund helped to create some of the most beautiful and highly regarded films of the silent era.  Freund was renowned for his daring camera angles, and his lighting effects, the latter a hallmark of the expressionism school. In 1924, he worked on ""The Last Laugh"" with Murnau and screenwriter Carl Mayer. Mayer collaborated closely with Freund to write a script exploiting the potentials of a moving camera. The camera became an integral part of the narrative, interpreting and visualizing the central character's state of mind. To film one scene where the main character is intoxicated, Freund strapped the camera to his chest, batteries to his back for balance, and stumbled about like a drunken man."

Not only is Walt Disney an icon of the entertainment business, he is an all-around American icon. Born Walter Elias Disney on December 5, 1901 in Chicago, IL, Disney was the fourth son born to Elias Disney and Flora Call Disney. He had three older brothers; Herbert, Raymond, and Roy. In 1903, the youngest child, Ruth, was born. When Disney was four, his family moved to a farm in Marceline, Missouri. It was here that Disney developed his interest in drawing, starting when he was paid to draw the horse of the local doctor. He would practice by copying the front-page cartoons from his fathers' copies of Appeal to Reason magazine, and soon became proficient in watercolors and crayons. The Disney family moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 1911. While attending Benton Grammar School, Disney met fellow student Walter Pfeiffer, who became his best friend, and introduced young Walt to vaudeville and motion pictures. Around this time, Disney also began to show his entrepreneurial spirit: he and his brother Roy each purchased a newspaper route from the Kansas City Star and the Kansas City Times. For more than six years, the brothers would wake up at 4:30am every morning to deliver the Times before school, and then repeat the route that evening for the Star. Because of this, Disney often fell asleep during class, and his grades suffered. During this time, Disney also attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute, and took a correspondence course in cartooning. In 1917, the Disney family moved back to Chicago, after Elias bought stock in a local jelly company. Disney attended high school at McKinley High, where he was the cartoonist for the school paper, and often drew patriotic scenes about the first World War. He also continued his drawing education with night classes at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. Disney wanted to enlist in the Army and fight the Germans, but he was too young. After forging the date on his birth certificate, Disney was able to join the Red Cross, where he worked as an ambulance driver (he was in the same company as future McDonalds founder Ray Kroc). However, when he was finally shipped off to France, he arrived after the armistice. While in France, some of his cartoons were published in the army newspaper Stars and Stripes. Upon returning to Kansas City in October of 1919, Disney got a job as a commercial illustrator at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio. It was there that he became friends with fellow artist Ub Iwerks, who would become Disney's most important early collaborator. Disney and Iwerks were both laid off from Pesmen-Rubin in January 1920, at which point they briefly tried to start their own business, Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. When that didn't pan out, they both found employment at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where both men first became interested in cel animation. After parting ways with the Ad Company, Disney and a fellow artist, Fred Harman, began producing a series of short cartoons for the local Newman Theater, modernized takes on fairy tales which they dubbed ""Laugh-O-Grams."" In May of 1921, Disney, along with Iwerks, Rudolf Ising, and Fred Harman and brother Hugh, founded Laugh-O-Gram Studios. Unfortunately, they were not able to churn out content fast enough to keep the company financially solvent, and shortly after finishing work on ""Alice's Wonderland"" (1923), a 12-and-a-half minute short based on Lewis Carroll's classic, the company filed for bankruptcy. Disney then decided to move to Los Angeles, partially in order to be closer to his brother Roy, who was on the west coast convalescing from tuberculosis. The brothers founded the Walt Disney Company in late 1923, and signed a contract with film distributor Margaret J. Winkler to release ""Alice's Wonderland"" as well as six more shorts, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Disney convinced Iwerks to come to Hollywood in July of 1924. The next year, Disney married Lillian Bond, an ink artist he had hired shortly after the New Year. Lillian proved to be a grounding presence in Disney's life, and the couple would go on to have a daughter, Diane, and adopt another child, Sharon. In 1927, Winkler handed over distribution of Disney's Alice series to her husband, Charles Mintz, who often butted heads with Disney. After the Alice series ended in July of 1927, Disney and Iwerks created a series of shorts based around their newest character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, to be distributed by Mintz via Universal Pictures. Despite the success of this new series, the deal fell apart when Mintz pulled a series of power moves, first reducing Disney's producer fee, then buying up the intellectual property rites to Oswald, then stealing away a number of Disney's best artists. When Mintz threatened to start his own studio and produce the Oswald series himself, Disney called his bluff, but lost most of his animation staff, except for Iwerks. The pair soon began developing a successor to Oswald, with Iwerks suggesting a mouse. Disney came up with the name Mortimer Mouse, but his wife found the name to be pompous, and suggested that they go with Mickey instead. Iwerks drew Mickey, while Disney provided his voice. With the release of ""The Jazz Singer"" (1927) and the advent of talkies, Disney and Iwerks utilized sync sound to produce the first Mickey Mouse short, ""Steamboat Willie"" (1928). Distributed by former Universal Pictures executive Pat Powers, founder of the ""Powers Cinephone"" system, the short was an instant success. With the help of composer and arranger Carl Stalling, Disney developed the Silly Symphony series. The first installment, ""The Skeleton Dance"" (1929) was drawn and animated entirely by Iwerks. Disney then hired a number of local artists, who would eventually become known to animation aficionados as the Nine Old Men. In the wake of the runaway success of both Mickey Mouse and the Silly Symphonies, Disney felt that he was being denied the rightful share of profits from Powers. When Disney asked him for an increase in payment for his work, Powers balked, and to twist the knife deeper, hired Iwerks to work for him. Soon after, Stalling resigned, believing that the Walt Disney Company didn't stand a chance without Iwerks. All of the stress of this period lead to Disney suffering a nervous breakdown in October of 1931, shortly thereafter he and Lillian took an extended holiday in Cuba and Panama to recover. Before long, Disney came back stronger than ever, signing a distribution contract with Columbia Pictures, and releasing the very first Technicolor animated short, ""Flowers and Trees"" (1932). The short would win Disney his first Academy Award the following year, plus an honorary Award ""for the creation of Mickey Mouse."" To this day, Disney holds the record for most Academy Award nominations and Academy Award wins for a single person: he won 22 Oscars, and was nominated a staggering 59 times. However, despite this success, Disney was becoming bored with short films, and soon set his sights on making his first full-length cartoon, ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937). Despite industry predictions that the film would bankrupt the company, it was an instant classic, beloved by critics and audiences alike upon its release in December of 1937. Thus began what would become known as the Golden Age of Animation. The studio next began work on two new features, ""Pinocchio"" (1940) and ""Fantasia"" (1940). Though they are considered classics today, neither film was very successful when they first opened, largely due to a dropoff in revenues from Europe since World War II began in 1939. The double box office bombs left the country deeply in debt by the end of February 1941. Luckily, the studio's next feature, ""Dumbo"" (1941), was a critical and box office success. Shortly after ""Dumbo"" hit theaters, America entered World War II. Disney, an avowed patriot, formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit in order to make instructional films for the military, promotional films starring Donald Duck designed to sell war bonds, and a number of propaganda shorts, including the Oscar winning ""Der Fuehrer's Face"" (1943). These films helped keep the Disney Company afloat financially during the early 1940s - they had lost $200,000 on ""Bambi"" (1942), and soon racked up a debt of $4 million with the Bank of America. After the war ended, Disney more or less phased out the production of shorts entirely, deciding that features were more lucrative in the long run. In 1950, Disney released ""Cinderella"" (1950), the studio's first animated feature in eight years. The film was a smash hit, as were their first forays into live action features, ""Treasure Island"" (1950) and ""The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men"" (1952), both of which Disney were closely involved in. From here on in, Disney would devote less and less attention to his studio's animated films, largely entrusting such projects as ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1951) and ""Peter Pan"" (1953) to the Nine Old Men. In 1954, Disney broke ground on what would become his first major theme park, Disneyland, in Anaheim, California. The park opened in July of 1955, and despite early minor setbacks, Disneyland attracted 3.6 million guests in its opening year. The opening day of Disneyland had been broadcast on ABC, and this lead to Disney becoming interested in television production. First up was ""Walt Disney's Disneyland"" (ABC, 1955-), an anthology of cartoons, live-action features, and other ephemera from Disney's library. Newsweek called the series ""an American institution,"" and the positive ratings convinced ABC to green light  ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" (ABC, 1955-1996), Disney's first daily TV program. Disney was now increasingly focusing his efforts on projects that took him away from the studio. He created a short film, ""America the Beautiful"" (1959), as part of the 1959 American National Exhibition in Moscow, where he also acted as consultant. He also served as chairman of the Pageantry Committee for the 1960 Winter Olympics, designing the opening, closing, and medal ceremonies. Meanwhile, the Disney Company continued churning out highly successful animated films, often with little input from Disney himself, including ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955), ""Sleeping Beauty"" (1959), ""101 Dalmatians"" (1961), and ""The Sword in the Stone"" (1963). Towards the end of his life, Disney wanted to create further theme park attractions to match the success of Disneyland. He briefly considered building a ski resort in Mineral King, a glacial valley in the Sierra Nevadas. However, he soon decided on Orlando, Florida as the location for his next attraction, and in late 1965, he announced plans to begin developing ""Disney World."" This bigger and more elaborate counterpart to Disneyland would include ""the Magic Kingdom,"" as well as Disney's pet project, the ""Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow,"" commonly known as EPCOT. Disney spent much of the second half of 1966 looking for businesses to sponsor EPCOT, while also increasing his involvement in the studio's latest films, the animated adventure tale ""The Jungle Book"" (1967), the live-action comedic musical ""The Happiest Millionaire"" (1967), and the animated short ""Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day"" (1968), which would earn Disney his final Oscar, albeit posthumously. In November of 1966, Disney was diagnosed with lung cancer, the byproduct of a life spent chain smoking cigarettes. On November 30th, Disney was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital. He would never leave. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, of circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer. It was ten days after his 65th birthday."

Liotta was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1954. At the age of six-months he was adopted by a young couple who was heavily involved in Newark's Democratic Party. Although he would later seek out and meet his biological mother in the 2000s, Liotta always referred to his adoptive parents as his mother and father. When he was a young boy, both of Liotta's parents ran unsuccessfully for office in Newark. In fact, one of Ray's earliest memories was handing out flyers during one of his father's campaigns. Went it came time to enter college, Liotta attended Miami University in South Florida. It was there that he first took an interest in acting, admittedly because it was a way to meet girls. After appearing in a few school plays, however, Liotta was hooked and started taking acting more seriously. He eventually graduated with a degree in Fine Arts in 1978 and immediately moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. Within a few short months Liotta got an agent and was cast in a recurring role on the daytime soap opera ""Another World"" (NBC, 1964-1999). Liotta played the role of Joey Perrini on the soap from 1978 to 1981. After a few years on ""Another World"" Liotta began getting the itch to broaden his acting horizons. Plus he was beginning to feel limited creatively by being on a soap opera. So he quit the show in 1981 and moved to L.A. to take a swing at a film acting career. He nabbed his first film role in 1983's ""Lonely Lady,"" and from there joined the cast of the short-lived ABC drama series ""Our Family Honor"" (ABC, 1985). Liotta's first breakout film role came in 1986 when he was cast as a violent ex-con in Jonathan Demme's ""Something Wild."" His role in the quirky crime comedy put Liotta on the map. In 1989 he played the blacklisted ballplayer Shoeless Joe Jackson in the fantasy sports film ""Field of Dreams."" ""Field of Dreams"" was nominated for three Oscars, including one Best Picture. With his acting career on the upward trajectory, Liotta was cast in the role of a lifetime in 1990 when he played the hot-headed mobster Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese's gangster film ""Goodfellas."" Liotta's role as Hill was hailed by critics, and proved to be so transformative that nearly three decades after the film premiered he admitted to still being stopped on the street by fans of the film. ""Goodfellas"" was a highpoint in Liotta's career, and over the next two decades he continued to build a solid body of work with noteworthy performances in films like ""Cop Land,"" ""Blow"" (2001), ""Narc,"" and ""Bee Movie"" (2007). In 2016 Liotta returned to TV by starring alongside Jennifer Lopez on NBC's cop drama ""Shades of Blue"" (NBC, 2016-18). However, NBC decided not to renew the series after its third season. In 2019 Liotta appeared in a film by noted indie director Noah Baumbach. That film, ""Marriage Story,"" starred Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver."

After winning a Theatre World Award for her Broadway turn in ""The House of Blue Leaves,"" Hagerty concentrated on character roles, playing wife to Richard Dreyfuss in the comedy hit ""What About Bob?"" (1991) and mother to Tom Green in ""Freddy Got Fingered"" (2001), Jason Lee in ""A Guy Thing"" (2003) and Ryan Reynolds in ""Just Friends"" (2005).

Because of his long, successful stint on what many considered the greatest show of all time, Alda managed to branch out of acting into writing and directing, becoming the only creative personality to have won Emmy awards in all three categories. Prior to ""M*A*S*H,"" Alda was an acclaimed actor on stage and in films, making notable performances in ""Purlie Victorious"" (1961-62), ""The Apple Tree"" (1966-67) and ""Paper Lion"" (1968). After directing the last episode of ""M*A*S*H,"" the most watched series finale in history, Alda went on to further success, both in front of and behind the camera, directing and starring in ""The Four Seasons"" (1981), ""Sweet Liberty"" (1986) and ""A New Life"" (1988). He delivered strong, acclaimed performances in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989) and ""And the Band Played On"" (HBO, 1993), both of which turned his nice guy persona on its head. By the time he won an Emmy for playing a Republican presidential candidate on ""The West Wing"" (NBC, 1999-2006), Alda was revered for being one of the most accomplished and versatile actors in the business.

Born and raised in Arkansas, Inboden's quick rise to TV stardom did not come without its setbacks. Inboden attended Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and was attending class when two gunmen opened fire on their fellow students. Although Inboden had survived the massacre, which took the lives of four students and one teacher, the experience left her permanently traumatized. She was able to overcome the emotional scarring from the massacre, however, by turning her pain into art. After moving to Chicago in 2006 to pursue a career in acting, she teamed up with playwright Evan Linder, who was so moved by her telling of the story, he wrote a play about it called ""The Warriors."" The play premiered in Chicago in 2011 to great critical acclaim, and shortly after her acting career began to take off. She landed a recurring role on the police drama ""The Chicago Code"" (Fox, 2011), but the show was cancelled after its initial 13 episodes. Undeterred, Inboden nabbed a recurring part on the Chicago-based political drama ""Boss"" (Starz, 2011-12), appearing in 13 of the series' 18 episodes. Inboden turned her attention to comedy over the next few years with recurring roles on the web series ""Kam Kardashian"" (web series, 2012-14) and ""Funemployed"" (web series, 2009-2014), before landing her big break by joining the cast of the ABC sitcom ""The Real O'Neals.""

Her first bigger role was in the Kirsten Dunst-starring ""All I Wanna Do"" (1998). As she studied acting in New York City, she focused more on theater early on, though she still appeared in ""Signs"" (2002) and ""The Wire"" (HBO 2002-2008) in the early 2000s. As she reached her late 20s, she started appearing in more major films, including ""Michael Clayton"" (2007), ""Into the Wild"" (2007), and ""Tiny Furniture"" (2010).

A childhood spent in art house theaters, soaking in Howard Hawks, FranÃ§ois Truffaut and Jean Renoir, helped inform his lifelong ambition to become a filmmaker. Baumbach's passionate, almost obsessive love for film was finally realized when he helmed his debut feature, ""Kicking and Screaming"" (1995), on through his seminal film, ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005) - the quasi-autobiographical drama that positioned him firmly inside the pantheon of meaningful filmmakers.

His love of theater led him to the world of movie production, first for major Hollywood studios and later striking out on his own. His love of books and literature led him to emerging British author J. K. Rowling, who had authored a children's fantasy novel that would achieve worldwide fame. In 1997, his production company obtained the movie rights to Rowling's Harry Potter books, leading to eight hugely successful feature films, earning billions at the global box office. In 2013, he reteamed with director Alfonso CuarÃ³n on the science-fiction thriller ""Gravity,"" which was released to commercial and critical acclaim, including seven Academy Awards. Heyman was born in London in 1961 to John Heyman, producer of such films as ""The Go-Between"" (1970) and ""Jesus"" (1979), and Norma Heyman, actress and Oscar-nominated producer of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1988) and ""Mrs. Henderson Presents"" (2005). He attended school at Westminster School, London, and earned an Art History degree from Harvard, then traveled the world. Entering Hollywood in 1984, Heyman paid his dues and rose up the industry ladder: creative director at Warner Brothers; vice president at United Artists. In 1992, he moved to independent production with the acclaimed urban drama ""Juice"" (1992). Five years later, he returned to London and founded a new production company, Heyman Films. As an independent producer, Heyman discovered an unknown writer named J. K. Rowling. He fell in love with her children's fantasy novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and quickly obtained the rights to adapt Rowling's books to the big screen. With a $2 million investment, Heyman's carefully crafted Harry Potter movies earned over $7 billion in box office revenue. Alfonso CuarÃ³n, who directed the third Potter feature, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004), invited Heyman to produce his science-fiction film ""Gravity"" (2013). Mixing pioneering special effect technologies and powerful performances from stars Sandra Bullock, George Clooney and Ed Harris, ""Gravity"" became a blockbuster smash, earning over $700 million at the box office, and was also critically hailed as a masterwork. The film went on to win 6 BAFTA awards, a Golden Globe, and seven Academy Awards. Heyman next produced a TV adaptation of the gothic novel ""The Thirteenth Tale"" (BBC Two, 2013), followed by a CGI-based screen version of Michael Bond's beloved children's book series ""Paddington"" (2014) and an adaptation of World War I memoir ""Testament of Youth"" (2014) starring Alicia Vikander. Vikander also co-starred in period drama ""The Light Between Oceans"" (2016). The same year, Heyman reunited with Rowling for the prequel film ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" (2016)."

Born in Karachi, Pakistan in 1978, Nanjiani moved to Iowa with his family when he was 18. In college, he first discovered stand-up by listening to his uncle's tapes of comedy acts, and he became obsessed. By his junior year in college he began doing his own stand-up routines. His major in computer sciences, gave him a solid nerd-culture base for his act as he drifted slowly into the comedy world of New York City. He worked briefly as a writer on ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ), but his work on the short-lived sketch program ""Michael and Michael Have Issues"" (Comedy Central 2009) gave him his first taste of acting. The producers wanted the writers to also have bit parts on the show, and Nanjiani discovered that the acting informed his writing, and the writing improved his acting. Along with his burgeoning stand-up career, Nanjiani had small roles in the films ""Life As We Know It"" (2010) and ""The Five Year Engagement"" (2012). During this era, Nanjiani moved from New York to Los Angeles, where podcast impresario Chris Hardwick invited him to create a show about comic books. Since he knew video games much better, he convinced Hardwick to center the show on video game obsessions. The podcast, The Indoor Kids, was co-hosted by Nanjiani's wife, comic and writer Emily V. Gordon. As if the television appearances, movies and podcasts weren't enough, Nanjiani also started co-hosting a weekly stand-up show in the back room of a Los Angeles comic book store called The Meltdown alongside fellow comic Jonah Ray. The show, which featured rising and known comics doing new, improvisational and experimental material, was so successful that in 2014 Comedy Central signed it up to become one of the network's live comedy showcases; the shows ended in 2016 when the pair's other duties began taking too much of their time. Nanjiani also continued to act, appearing regularly as various characters on Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein's offbeat comedy series ""Portlandia"" (IFC 2011- ) and taking on a co-starring role in Mike Judge's satirical series ""Silicon Valley"" (HBO 2014- ).

Born in London in 1980, Akhtar initially pursued a career in law but after graduating from university with a degree in the subject, switched his attention to acting, going onto study at the National Youth Theatre and New York's Actors Studio Drama School. His first on-screen appearance came in 2006 with a minor role in an episode of ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" (NBC, 2001-2011) and was followed by small parts in short-lived legal drama ""Conviction"" (NBC, 2006) and Don Cheadle spy thriller ""Traitor"" (2008). Akhtar landed his first lead role when he was cast as Mani, a homeless man who develops an unlikely bond with the grieving widow who offers him shelter, in slow-burning drama ""Stranger Things"" (2010). But he came to wider attention later that year when he played naive Muslim extremist Faisal in Chris Morris' controversial jihad satire, ""Four Lions"" (2010). Akhtar continued to showcase his comic skills as sidekick Gupta in surreal chat show ""Angelos Epithemiou's Moving On"" (Channel 4, 2010), one of several minions in Sacha Baron Cohen vehicle ""The Dictator"" (2012) and over-enthusiastic fraud investigator George in sitcom ""The Job Lot"" (ITV, 2013-). Akhtar then joined the cast of supermarket-based comedy ""Trollied"" (Sky 1, 2011-) as reclusive fishmonger Ray and appeared as Vinod in 'food, feud and family' feature film ""Jadoo"" (2013) before stealing the show in mind-bending cult hit ""Utopia"" (Channel 4, 2013-14) as the one-eyed conspiracy theorist Wilson. Returning to more dramatic fare, Akhtar then guested in an episode of ""The Tunnel"" (Sky Atlantic, 2013-), the UK adaptation of the Scandinavian crime noir, appeared as one of many government officials practicing their response to an immediate nuclear threat in the thought-provoking ""War Book"" (2014), and played detective Ira King in the Abi Morgan-scripted ""River"" (BBC1, 2015-). Following roles in heist comedy ""Convenience"" (2015) and ""The Show"" (2015), a behind-the-curtains drama about a young TV actress' stage debut, Akhtar landed the part of Captain Hook's right hand man Mr. Smee in Joe Wright's fantasy adventure ""Pan"" (2015)."

A Detroit native, he found acclaim early on the New York stage, earning a Tony nomination for playing baseball legend Jackie Robinson in the musical ""The First."" He moved onto film acting with a role in Robert Altman's Vietnam drama ""Streamers"" (1983). He later joined the cast of Norman Jewison's critically acclaimed ""A Soldier's Story"" (1984), playing a role that he had done on stage in Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prize winning play. He began moving towards comedy with his next role opposite Rip Torn and Loretta Swit in ""Beer"" (1985). After appearing in the short-lived sitcom ""All Is Forgiven"" (NBC, 1986), Grier began a run of supporting roles in films like ""From the Hip"" (1987) and ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" (1987), and television shows such as ""A Different World"" (NBC, 1987-93), ""ALF"" (NBC,1986-90), and ""Tour of Duty"" (CBS, 1987-90). A small role in the action-spoof comedy ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"" (1988) brought him into the circle of actor/director/producer Keenan Ivory Wayans. Grier's relationship with Wayans and his siblings would prove to be extremely fruitful. He joined the cast of Wayans' influential sketch comedy show ""In Living Color"" (Fox, 1990-94) at the show's inception, and was one of the few performers to stay for the show's entire run. With his profile raised, he filmed a cameo for Altman's black comedy ""The Player"" (1992) before embarking on a successful run of supporting parts in films like ""Boomerang"" (1992), alongside Eddie Murphy, ""Blankman"" (1994), with Damon Wayans, and ""In the Army Now"" (1994), opposite Pauly Shore. He also played a recurring character on Martin Lawrence's hit sitcom, ""Martin"" (Fox, 1992-97). After ""In Living Color"" ended, he appeared on film in the Robin Williams' blockbuster ""Jumanji"" (1995), as well as the film adaption of the 1960s sitcom ""McHale's Navy"" (1997). On TV, he starred in the short-lived sitcoms ""The Preston Episodes"" (Fox, 1995) and ""Damon"" (Fox, 1998), again with Damon Wayans. He found more sustained success with ""Life With Bonnie"" (ABC, 2002-04) and a recurring role on ""My Wife and Kids"" (ABC, 2001-05). He enjoyed something of a resurgence in the 2010s, starting with a starring role opposite Kerry Washington and Craig Robinson in ""Peeples"" (2013). He landed the role of the Cowardly Lion in the television musical ""The Wiz Live!"" (NBC, 2015), and joined the cast of Jerrod Carmichael's edgy sitcom ""The Carmichael Show"" (NBC, 2015-17), playing the main character's opinionated father. Similar to ""The Wiz,"" Grier played Santa Claus in the TV musical ""A Christmas Story Live!"" (Fox, 2017). He subsequently joined the cast of ""The Cool Kids"" (Fox, 2018-) playing a retiree opposite fellow veteran performers Vicki Lawrence and Martin Mull."

He met up with like-minded budding comedians including David Wain, Thomas Lennon and Michael Ian Black and formed the comedy group The State. Even though Showalter wound up transferring to Brown University, he still remained close with his friends at The State, as he was a part of the gang's big break in 1993, when they started sketch comedy show ""The State"" (MTV 1993-95). While the show was short-lived, it kicked off Showalter's career. Throughout the rest of the '90s, Showalter appeared in small roles in film and TV before he worked with Wain to write cult classic ""Wet Hot American Summer"" (2001), which he also starred in. He followed that with another barrage of small roles, including a guest role on ""Sex and the City"" (HBO 1998-2004). He made his directorial debut with ""The Baxter"" (2005), and also returned to TV regularly with ""Stella"" (Comedy Central 2005), another comedy show also starring Wain and Black. For the next few years, Showalter focused more on his stand-up career, releasing a comedy album and going on tour with Black, Janeane Garofalo, and more. He returned to Comedy Central with the metafictional sitcom ""Michael and Michael Have Issues"" (Comedy Central 2009), which also starred Black. In 2014, Showalter worked with Wain on the Paul Rudd-starring romantic comedy parody ""They Came Together"" (2014), and wrote and directed his first dramatic feature, the Sally Field-starring ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" (2015).

Upon enrollment in University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1997, Gordon pursued a major in psychology, accruing a Bachelor's degree therein, followed by a Master's of Science in Education in couple's counseling in 2003. Over the six years to follow, Gordon practiced therapy professionally, first in North Carolina, then in Chicago, IL, where she met and began a romantic relationship with then-aspiring comedian and actor Kumail Nanjiani. In 2007, Gordon was diagnosed with Still's disease and placed into a medically induced coma for eight days, an experience that would inspire her first screenplay a decade later. Following this episode, Gordon and Nanjiani moved to New York City, where they married, and then to Los Angeles, at which point she eschewed her standing psychotherapy practice to pursue a career as a writer. She began contributing to publications including The New York Times, The Huffington Post, and The Atlantic, among many others; around the same time, she and Nanjiani, along with comedian Jonah Ray, began producing a weekly live performance hosted at Los Angeles' Meltdown Comics. The popularity of the show earned Gordon the attention of entertainer and Nerdist CEO Chris Hardwick, who hired her in 2011 to serve as program director of the regular live performance Nerdist Showroom; the project also earned the attention of Comedy Central, which launched the television series ""The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail"" (Comedy Central 2014-16), which featured the irrepressibly perky Gordon in her backstage role as the show's producer and manager. During production of the program, Gordon and Nanjiani collaborated on their first feature screenplay ""The Big Sick"" (2017), which chronicled their romantic relationship and Gordon's experiences with the aforementioned medically-induced coma."

Considered one of the hottest comedy ""punch-up"" men in the industry, Apatow's services were originally in high demand as a script doctor. As a television producer, however, Apatow's career was practically cursed. Plagued by a cycle of critical praise, cult followings and speedy cancellations, Apatow's work on such quality shows as ""The Ben Stiller Show"" (Fox, 1992-93), ""The Larry Sanders Show"" (HBO, 1992-98), ""Freaks and Geeks"" (NBC, 1999-2000) and ""Undeclared"" (Fox, 2001-02 ) were a mixed bag of blessings. Still, the quality of his work won Apatow more than a small measure of respect. In 2005, he became a triple-threat by making his film directorial debut, resulting in a homerun with the ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005). The film not only put him on the map, it made a marquee name out of its star, Steve Carell and ushered in a new era of sophomoric R-rated comedies with heart. With a reserve of respect built up after the instant comedy classic that was ""Virgin,"" expectations were high for Apatow's second directorial outing - the comedically fertile 2007 comedy, ""Knocked Up."" Proving his first foray was no fluke, his next several films as a writer and director were embraced by fans and critics alike for their blend of raunch and emotional realism. Soon, every comedic actor in town looked to join the very exclusive Apatow comedy repertory company - an elite, tight-knit group that included Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Will Ferrell, Carell and Apatow's wife, Leslie Mann. A pair of more personal serio-comic films, ""Funny People"" (2009) and ""This Is 40"" (2012), were somewhat less commercially successful, but Apatow continued producing a string of hilarious and inventive films and TV shows, from ""Freaks and Geeks"" creator Paul Feig's smash ""Bridesmaids"" (2011) to Lena Dunham's ""Girls"" (HBO 2012-17). A big-screen collaboration with comedian Amy Schumer, the raunchy romantic comedy ""Trainwreck"" (2015), revived his box office fortunes at the same time that his first book, a collection of interviews with fellow comedians called Sick in the Head, proved that Apatow remained a lifelong student of comedy."

His first film as a producer was the quirky Wes Anderson comedy ""Rushmore"" in 1998. It was Anderson's breakthrough film (his second, after 1996's ""Bottle Rocket""), and it featured a lead performance by Jason Schwartzman that launched his successful acting career. Mendel would go on to collaborate with Anderson on his two subsequent films, the eccentric comedies ""The Royal Tennenbaums"" in 2001 and ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" in 2004, each stylistically similar in its use of deadpan humor and a hip, frequently-implemented soundtrack. In 1999, Mendel was one of the producers on the mystery thriller ""The Sixth Sense,"" a huge sleeper hit for writer-director M. Night Shyamalan. Mendel would team up with Shyamalan again, first in 2000 on the fantasy thriller ""Unbreakable,"" and then not again until 2008 on his sci-fi thriller ""The Happening."" In 2009, Mendel moved back into comedy, albeit black comedy, in Judd Apatow's 2009 tale of a fictional stand-up comic, played by Adam Sandler, in ""Funny People.""  Another Mendel collaborator came in the form of Ellen Page: Mendel produced 2009's roller derby drama, ""Whip It,"" and then in 2010 the thriller ""Peacock,"" both films featuring the actress as a lead. Mendel also produced the successful period thriller ""Munich"" directed by Steven Spielberg."

She would play variations on the role in several subsequent features, including ""A Hatful of Rain"" (1957), though Alfred Hitchcock would tap her inner sexiness as a double agent opposite Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest"" (1959). Sadly, the majority of Saint's films never rose to her skill level, so she found more substantive work on television, where she contributed greatly to such projects as ""Fatal Vision"" (1984) and ""People Like Us"" (1990). Her return to the big screen in ""Superman Returns"" (2006) reminded moviegoers not only of her timeless, ethereal beauty, but her acting chops, which - though rarely given their proper showcase - had been substantial enough to hold her own against the Brando's and Grant's of the world."

Cobb definitely belongs on that list. The Russian Jewish actor grew up in the Bronx to working-class parents and made his film debut at the age of 23 in ""The Vanishing Shadow."" He was associated with the progressive Group Theatre and was named as a possible Communist by the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare. Cobb's bearing and dignity allowed him to play roles much older than his actual age, which was an enormous asset at the time. In amongst his massive and varied filmography, some of his most memorable roles include playing opposite Marlon Brando as union boss Johnny Friendly in Elia Kazan's 1954 ""On The Waterfront""--for which he received an Academy Award nomination--as well as the third juror in Sidney Lumet's 1957 courtroom drama, ""12 Angry Men,"" and Lieutenant Kinderman in the 1973 horror classic ""The Exorcist."" He also did television work, starring as Judge Henry Garth on four seasons of NBC's Western series ""The Virginian.""

In the ensuing years, Steiger racked up a rÃ©sumÃ© of incendiary film appearances, as Brando's gangster brother in ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), as a prairie psychopath in ""Oklahoma!"" (1955), and as an embittered Civil War veteran who goes native in ""Run of the Arrow"" (1957). Lured to Europe for roles of greater depth than those Hollywood offered, Steiger returned stateside to play Sidney Lumet's ""The Pawnbroker"" (1964) and won an Academy Award as a bigoted Southern lawman who comes to respect black colleague Sidney Poitier in ""In the Heat of the Night"" (1967). Steiger maintained a steady workload over the years, playing priests, judges, army generals, presidents, doctors and mobsters on cinema and television screens, at home and abroad. At the time of his death in 2002, Steiger was honored as a fascinating personality, an uncompromising artist whose love of craft inspired generations of cinematic angry young men."

His first love was music, and he worked first as a vocalist and trombone player. After dabbling in theater, he moved into films, playing alongside Buster Crabbe in a series of Westerns based on the stories of Zane Grey. Though the parts kept coming, Erickson took a four-year break from acting to serve in World War II, returning afterward to success in such notable films as ""The Snake Pit,"" a drama of life in a psychiatric hospital, and ""Show Boat,"" the 1951 version of the famous musical. Erickson continued to work steadily in supporting roles, including that of an investigator in the classic drama of life on the docks, ""On the Waterfront."" After numerous spots on anthology and Western series, he landed the top spot on ""The High Chaparral"" as the head of a family of ranchers, leading the show for four seasons. Once that show ended, he mainly played one-off parts on TV series through the '70s. His final appearance came in 1984 in an episode of ""Fantasy Island."" In his personal life, Erickson gained some notoriety for trading actress wives in 1942, divorcing Frances Farmer and marrying Margaret Hayes on the same day."

Later, Henning acted in the Burl Ives dramatic adventure ""Wind Across the Everglades""  (1958) and ""Once Upon a Christmas Time""  (NBC, 1959-1960).

After a string of similarly small roles, he earned his first worthwhile supporting role in the 1946 film-noir thriller ""Undercurrent,"" which starred Katharine Hepburn and Robert Mitchum. Westerfield would go on to perform in 55 films over a career that spanned 35 years, appearing opposite some of Hollywood's brightest stars. In the Oscar-winning drama ""On the Waterfront,"" he shared screen time with onscreen heavyweight Marlon Brando, and later sparred with John Wayne's Oscar-winning Rooster Cogburn in the 1969 Western adventure ""True Grit."" To young audiences, Westfield is likely best remembered as the awestruck cop from a trio of Disney's fantasy-comedies: the shapeshifting adventure ""The Shaggy Dog,"" the high-flying comedy ""The Absent-Minded Professor,"" and one of its sequels, ""Son of Flubber."" With the emergence of television in the 1950s, Westerfield branched out, appearing in more than 90 different programs before his death from a heart attack in 1971. His final film appearance unrolled posthumously in 1975; he had earned a lead in the gruff Western ""Dead Aim"" as a compassionate undertaker who takes in an abandoned boy."

(NBC, 1961-63) and ""The Munsters"" (CBS, 1964-66). In the former, a broad slapstick police comedy, Gwynne portrayed the quietly hapless Officer Muldoon. ""The Munsters,"" a freaky family comedy, exploited his resemblance to Boris Karloff by casting him as Herman Munster--a Frankenstein's Monster look-alike who was a devoted family man. Tall, greenish, and gruesome, Herman invariably frightened the neighbors but his sunny disposition made him quick to bellow with laughter. Gwynne reprised his signature character for a feature film ""Munster, Go Home"" (1966) and has haunted syndicated reruns ever since. He returned 15 years later for a TV-movie ""reunion,"" ""The Munsters' Revenge"" (NBC, 1981). Gwynne was especially convincing as quirky or somewhat melancholy authority figures, and he was well utilized in a number of films, including ""On the Waterfront"" as longshoreman Slim (1954); Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Luna"" (1979) in a cameo as Jill Clayburgh's ill-fated husband; ""The Cotton Club"" (1984) as a sympathetic underworld figure; ""The Boy Who Could Fly"" (1986), as the alcoholic uncle of the title character; ""Pet Sematary"" (1989) as a country gentleman; a bit part in Woody Allen's ""Shadows and Fog"" (1992); and a delicious final supporting role as a no-nonsense Southern judge in ""My Cousin Vinny"" (1992). Gwynne also had a significant career on the New York stage, appearing in various plays including ""Irma La Douce,"" ""Texas Trilogy,"" ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" ""Twelfth Night"" and ""The Winter's Tale."" Gwynne worked as an advertising copywriter in the late 50s while pursuing acting. In the 1980s, he made a good deal of his income doing voice-overs for TV commercials.

He began acting as a student at the University of Texas and made the move to NYC in the late 1940s. There, Hingle studied at the American Theater Wing and became a protege of director Elia Kazan at the Actor's Studio. He was soon working regularly on the NY stage, where he would appear in four Pulitzer Prize-winning plays (""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" 1955, ""J.B."" 1958, ""Strange Interlude"" 1963 and ""That Championship Season"" 1973). Hingle performed initially on TV in an adaptation of ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"" (1950) for CBS' ""Suspense,"" and his feature acting debut came in a small part as a bartender in Kazan's ""On the Waterfront"" (1954). He shone in a breakthrough supporting role in Kazan's ""Splendor in the Grass"" (1961), as the brusque father of Warren Beatty, but the greatest part of his career would have been the one that got away.

Along the way, he would win three Academy Awards for directing classics like ""On the Waterfront"" (1954) and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) and be the recipient of an equal number of Tony Awards for his direction of such Broadway landmarks as ""Death of a Salesman."" Kazan would be further lauded as a pioneer of social justice in cinema, and his daring examinations of topics like racial and religious prejudice came during a time when such things were discouraged by movie studios. Such displays of depth, daring and humanity influenced a generation of filmmakers including Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. Kazan's groundbreaking work with The Actor's Studio also earned him much credit for his promotion of ""The Method,"" and he was instrumental in launching the careers of such practitioners of that craft as Marlon Brando, James Dean and Warren Beatty."

In 1941, Schulberg penned the controversial roman a clef, What Makes Sammy Run?, a classic satire of Hollywood power, corruption and pretension. He joined John Ford's documentary unit during WWII and ""named names"" before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1951 - an experience that he obliquely examined in his Oscar-winning screenplay for Elia Kazan's gripping 1954 social drama, ""On the Waterfront."" Schulberg also wrote the cynical boxing novel The Harder They Fall (1947), which provided the basis for the 1956 film of the same name which proved to be Humphrey Bogart's final film. He again collaborated with Kazan on his blistering expose of media demagoguery, ""A Face in the Crowd"" (1957). In 1950, he wrote a thinly veiled account of F. Scott Fitzgerald in ""The Disenchanted"" (1950) which he co-adapted for the stage in 1958. In 1995, a stage adaptation of ""On the Waterfront"" briefly played on Broadway.

A Chicago native, he attended college in Wisconsin before moving to Los Angeles. He was signed to a contract by Columbia Pictures, towards the end of the contract players system, and began making minor appearances in the studio's productions. His first credited role was in the Western ""A Time for Killing"" (1967). He made several television appearances in shows including ""The Virginian"" (NBC, 1962-71), ""Gunsmoke"" (CBS, 1955-75), and ""Love,  American Style"" (ABC, 1969-74). He was cast by young filmmaker George Lucas in his nostalgia-tinged film ""American Graffiti"" (1973), playing a cocky street racer. The role didn't initially lead to a big upswing, and Ford continued stringing together small parts, including appearing in Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Conversation"" (1974). Discouraged, he began working regularly as a carpenter to supplement his income. Despite initial hesitation, Lucas eventually cast the actor alongside Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher in his sci-fi adventure ""Star Wars"" (1977). The film became a phenomenon and one of the biggest box office hits of all-time, with Ford's Han Solo garnering a legion of loyal fans. While he wasn't catapulted to immediate movie stardom, film roles did come easier. The actor had supporting roles in ""Heroes"" (1977) with Henry Winkler and Sally Field and the World War II film ""Force 10 from Navarone"" (1978). He starred in the romance ""Hanover Street"" (1979) and made an appearance in Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). His stardom became cemented soon after with a return to space in the ""Star Wars"" sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980). A new partnership with Lucas, this time with Steven Spielberg joining in, took Ford to a new level. Playing adventurous archeologist Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) turned the actor into a bona fide star. He followed with what would prove to be another iconic role as Rick Deckard in Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" (1982). He returned in short order to both of his famous heroes, playing Solo in ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983) and starring in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (1984). He began to branch out from the big budget adventures when he starred in ""Witness"" (1985) playing a police detective working undercover in an Amish community. The role earned the actor his lone Academy Award nomination. He began headlining films on a regular basis and added comedy to his resume with a role opposite Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver in ""Working Girl"" (1988). He closed out the 1980s by partnering with Sean Connery in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" (1989). The following decade saw the actor become a box office draw in his own right. He starred in the dramas ""Presumed Innocent"" (1990) and ""Regarding Henry"" (1991). He took over as Tom Clancy's literary hero Jack Ryan in ""Patriot Games"" (1992) and ""Clear and Present Danger"" (1994). He added to his legacy by playing the wrongly accused Dr. Richard Kimble, opposite Tommy Lee Jones, in the blockbuster ""The Fugitive"" (1993). He alternated action films such as ""Air Force One"" (1997) and ""The Devil's Own"" (1997) with lighter fare like ""Sabrina"" (1995) and ""Six Days Seven Nights"" (1998). After starring with Michelle Pfeiffer in Robert Zemeckis's ""What Lies Beneath"" (200), Ford began keeping a slower pace. He starred in ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" (2002), ""Hollywood Homicide"" (2003), and the thriller ""Firewall"" (2006), before returning to the famous archeologist. The actor dusted off his bullwhip for ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008) with Spielberg once again directing. Ford returned to the world of sci-fi by lending his talents to Jon Favreau's ""Cowboys & Aliens"" (2011) and starring in the adaptation of Orson Scott Card's classic novel ""Ender's Game"" (2013). He played true life baseball executive Branch Rickey in ""42"" (2013) about Jackie Robinson's integration of major league baseball. He also joined a Who's Who of action stars, including Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, in ""The Expendables 3"" (2014). After teaming with Blake Lively for ""The Age of Adaline"" (2015), he was given the chance to revisit the role that made him famous. The actor stepped into the familiar boots of Han Solo for J.J. Abrams'sÂ ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" (2015). Similarly, he teamed with Ryan Gosling in the long gestating sequel ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017) as Rick Deckard.

Both von Sydow and Bergman triumphantly emerged onto the international film scene with ""The Seventh Seal"" (1957), an existential meditation on death that was long after considered to be one of the greatest foreign films ever made. The actor and director continued their collaboration for the next several years, churning out complicated and often surreal films like ""The Magician"" (1958) and ""The Virgin Spring"" (1960) that earned international accolades and awards. When von Sydow crossed the Atlantic to appear in Hollywood films, however, he was initially consigned to playing stern, unsympathetic characters. He finally had a breakthrough playing the titular role in ""The Exorcist"" (1973), playing the immortal Father Merrin in a film that forever cemented von Sydow into cinema history. Following this, he was able to branch out and explore a variety of compelling roles, which culminated in an Academy Award nomination for his performance in ""Pelle the Conqueror"" (1988), which only confirmed the notion of von Sydow being Sweden's modern-day Laurence Olivier. His career spanned long after that triumph, including films ranging from medical drama ""Awakenings"" (1990) to science fiction thriller ""Minority Report"" (2002) to indie character study ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" (2007). He showed no signs of slowing down even into his 80s, appearing in Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" (2010), an episode of ""The Simpsons"" (Fox 1990- ), and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015).

The 7-foot-3 London native was working as a hospital orderly when he began dabbling in acting. He played the Minoton in the Sam Wanamaker-Ray Harryhausen fantasy ""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger"" (1977). Director George Lucas cast Mayhew in ""Star Wars"" in large part because he wanted someone taller than David Prowse, the 6-foot-6 actor who was filling the suit of the evil Darth Vader. Covered entirely in fur, Mayhew was the co-pilot to Harrison Ford's roguish pilot, Han Solo. He played the character in the two other legs of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983). He added additional roles while filming the sci-fi classics, appearing in the horror film ""Terror"" (1978) and portraying the Tall Knight on ""Dark Towers"" (BBC, 1981). He took his responsibilities as Chewbacca seriously, however, and he played the 200-year-old Wookie at every opportunity. He joined with other cast members in appearances on ""Donny & Marie"" (ABC, 1976-79), ""The Muppet Show"" (ITV, 1976-81), and the ill-fated ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"" (CBS, 1978). He still continued working as an orderly throughout the first three ""Star Wars"" films, but thereafter made a living out of his status as Chewie. He appeared regularly at conventions and quickly became a fan favorite thanks to his generous nature and pleasant personality. He was able to don the Wookie costume for real once again in the final of Lucas' prequels, ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005). That kicked off a fresh round of appearances as Chewbacca, with Mayhew popping up on ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" (CBS, 1993-2015) and ""Glee"" (Fox, 2009-15). He still acted on occasion beyond the ""Star Wars"" universe, appearing in the indie drama ""Yesterday Was a Lie"" (2008) and the Christian Slater-Megan Mullally sitcom ""Breaking In"" (Fox, 2011-12). While he was beginning to struggle physically, he teamed with Ford to play Chewbacca one last time time in J.J. Abrams' ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" (2015).

After years of stage work and several small roles in indie films and on television, he found a powerful advocate in director Brett Ratner, who first cast him in the action-comedy ""Rush Hour"" (1998) and later in the thriller ""Red Dragon"" (2002). He went on to exhibit extraordinary dexterity in projects as diametrically opposed as the horror movie ""Saw"" (2004) and the family drama ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005). Counted among the filmmaker's favorite actors, Ratner brought Leung onboard once again for the final chapter of the superhero franchise, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006). One year later, the Asian-American actor gave such a magnificently raw performance as a mental patient in a final season episode of ""The Sopranos"" (HBO, 1999-2007), that producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse created a role specifically for him on their hit series ""Lost"" (ABC, 2004-2010). The fact that the character Miles became a fan favorite after being dropped into such an established ensemble cast was a true testament to Leung's ability. Equally capable of deeply nuanced dramatic turns and disarmingly comic performances, Leung was a true actor's actor."

Using his dwarfism to his advantage from an early age, Baker went directly from school to the world of entertainment, working in the theater, the circus, and even in a long-running ice show. Teaming with Jack Purvis, another similarly vertically-challenged performer, he formed the successful musical-comedy act The Mini-Tones prior to being cast in the blockbuster ""Star Wars."" Baker returned for the sequel ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), in addition to appearances in ""The Elephant Man"" (1980), ""Time Bandits"" (1981) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" (1983). There were other small roles in films like ""Amadeus"" (1984) and ""Labyrinth"" (1986) prior to Baker's return to the stage and comedy circuit before he was called back into service by ""Star Wars"" director George Lucas in 1999. With the completion of the third prequel film, ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005), Baker and co-star Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) became the only two actors to perform in all six of the original ""Star Wars"" films. Although hidden within a metallic shell, Baker's performance imbued the adorably cantankerous R2-D2 with a humanity appreciated by generations of fans the world over. Kenny Baker died on August 13, 2016, following an exended illness. He was 81."

Meanwhile, his script for ""Continental Divide"" (1981) captured the attention of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, the latter of whom hired Kasdan to write ""Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), widely considered to be the best film in the franchise. He collaborated with Spielberg and Lucas again on ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981), a splashy action adventure that harkened back to the 1930s Saturday matinee serials. He next made his directorial debut with the steaming erotic noir ""Body Heat"" (1981), after which he wrote ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" (1983).

Born in Helena, Montana, the actress relocated as a child with her family to Los Angeles. She began appearing around LA as a dancer in her teens. She was soon acting in small parts in silent films, making her screen debut as a dancer in ""Pretty Ladies"" (1925). Between 1925 and 1930, Loy appeared in 54 films, including a brief appearance in the first feature with sound, ""The Jazz Singer"" (1927). Besides showcasing her skills as a dancer, the actress was typically used as a young temptress in these roles, and was frequently used to play Asian characters. She began graduating to larger roles in the early-'30s, starring opposite Will Rogers in ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1931) and ""Love Me Tonight"" (1932) with Maurice Chevalier. She also played social-climbing Becky Sharp in ""Vanity Fair"" (1932). She was cast opposite Clark Gable in ""Manhattan Melodrama"" (1934), a film that also featured William Powell. Shortly thereafter, Loy and Powell began one of Hollywood's most historic pairings when the played socialite detectives Nick and Nora Charles in ""The Thin Man"" (1934). The duo went on to play Hammett's characters in five sequels. Outside of the series, they also starred together in six additional films, including ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (1936) and ""Love Crazy"" (1941). Dubbed the ""Queen of the Movies"" during her heyday, she was paired multiple times with Gable, ""The King,"" most notably in ""Too Hot to Handle"" (1938). During World War II, she took a break from acting to work with the Red Cross. After the war, she starred in the Oscar-winning ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946) about veterans returning home. After frequently playing an idealized wife, she moved to playing idealized mother characters in popular films like ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" (1950). She also formed yet another on-screen partnership, this time with Cary Grant, in the box-office hits ""The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer"" (1947) and ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream Home"" (1948). During the 1950s, Loy began working more on television and in supporting roles, including starring in a TV adaption of the Judy Garland hit, ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" (CBS, 1959). For the rest of her career, she primarily appeared in guest roles on TV series such as ""Family Affair"" (CBS, 1966-71) and ""Columbo"" (NBC, 1968-78), and a series of television movies, including a late-career pairing with Henry Fonda in ""Summer Solstice"" (1981). In the '60s and '70s, she also began a new chapter in her career by appearing in various stage productions. In feature films, she joined an all-star cast for the disaster film ""Airport 1975"" and appeared in the Burt Reynolds comedy ""The End"" (1978).  Her last on-screen performance was a guest role on the Tony Randall sitcom, ""Love, Sydney"" (NBC, 1981-83) in 1982.

Wright avoided the sophomore slump with Oscar nominations for her next two movies, winning as Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Greer Garson's daughter-in-law in Wyler's ""Mrs. Miniver"" while falling short in the Best Actress category as the wife of Lou Gehrig (Gary Cooper) in ""Pride of the Yankees"" (both 1942).

But it was his collaboration with actress Bette Davis - which was punctuated by an on-again, off-again romance - that elevated his career to the next level, starting with ""Jezebel"" (1938). He went on to earn Academy Award nominations for ""Wuthering Heights"" (1939), ""The Letter"" (1941) and ""The Little Foxes"" (1941), before winning his first Oscar for ""Mrs. Miniver"" (1942).

With ""M"" (1931), his first movie with sound, he crafted a dark and disturbing tale that introduced the wider world to actor Peter Lorre. After fleeing the Nazis following ""The Testament of Dr. Mabuse"" (1933), Lang found his way to Hollywood, where he began a long tenure directing a variety of genres, though ultimately specializing in film noir like ""Fury"" (1936). He tried his hand at the Western with ""The Return of Frank James"" (1940) and ""Western Union"" (1941), both of which proved exceedingly popular with audiences, before returning his focus almost exclusively on noirs like ""The Woman in the Window"" (1944) and ""Scarlet Street"" (1945). Following another popular Western, ""Rancho Notorious"" (1952), starring Marlene Dietrich, Lang directed ""The Big Heat"" (1953), a classic film noir long considered on of the best ever made in the genre. He made only a few more films for Hollywood before returning to Germany, where he ended his career on a soft note with ""The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse"" (1960).

The goal was to make a film that worked like time-lapse photography, done more realistically than having Coltrane age through CGI or motion capture special effects. Once all the footage was finally assembled into the finished film, ""Boyhood"" was a critical hit, and won a number of festival awards as well."
1565,Patricia Arquette,4/8/1968,"Chicago, Illinois, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/qj8oL3QD3rp8JzozxgdjbOwjSFk=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/49940_v9_bc.jpg,"It can certainly be said that Patricia Arquette hails from a show business family. Of the actor's four siblings, three of them-David, Rosanna, and Alexis Arquette-were actors as well. Arquette was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1968 to Brenda and Lewis Arquette, the latter of whom was also an actor. The family moved from Chicago to a commune in Virginia for a period of time before returning to Chicago and then eventually, settling in Los Angeles. Arquette took an interest in acting at a young age, though she entertained interests in becoming a midwife or even a nun. Her home life could be extremely unstable and often violent, and so at age 14, Arquette ran away and began living with her older sister Rosanna, who was already a working actor. Arquette made her screen debut in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors"" (1987). Parts followed in projects like the Sam Shepard ensemble film ""Far North"" (1988) and the gritty drama ""The Indian Runner"" (1991) before she landed the role of Alabama in ""True Romance"" (1993), a quirky crime drama written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Tony Scott. The movie became a sleeper sensation and Arquette became an in-demand actor, quickly moving on to star in the adventure drama ""Beyond Rangoon"" (1995) in 1995, the same year she married fellow actor Nicolas Cage-though it was revealed later that the couple separated after less than a year before eventually divorcing in 2000. Arquette continued to appear in prestige projects such as David Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" (1997) and Martin Scorsese's ""Bringing Out the Dead"" (1999). Then in 2005, Arquette began starring on the hit TV series ""Medium"" (NBC, 2005-2011) beginning a new phase in her fame. She married actor Thomas Jane the following year, and though their marriage ended the same year that ""Medium"" wrapped in 2011, Arquette was soon impressing audiences once again as she joined the cast of the acclaimed period crime series ""Boardwalk Empire"" (HBO, 2010-2014) in 2013. The next year saw the release of a project Arquette had been working on for several years, the real-time coming-of-age film ""Boyhood"" (2014), which earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She moved on to star on ""CSI: Cyber"" (CBS, 2015-2016) before earning tremendous acclaim portraying disturbed mother Dee Dee Blanchard in the limited series ""The Act"" (Hulu, 2019-2019), based on the true story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard."
1566,Ethan Hawke,11/6/1970,"Austin, Texas, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/28namVRGX7UCM-knTG6-y6_aOtA=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/20237_v9_bb.jpg,"Even though he exhibited star-making potential in films like ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989) and ""Reality Bites"" (1994), actor Ethan Hawke chose instead to be something of a Gen-X Renaissance Man, starring in offbeat movies, publishing modestly-acclaimed novels, directing artsy independent films and even forming his own Manhattan-based theater company. Though he did make occasional forays into pricey studio films like ""Gattaca"" (1997), ""Great Expectations"" (1998) and ""Training Day"" (2001), Hawke was more at home pursuing his artistic ambitions for art's sake, not for large pay days or widespread recognition. Perhaps nowhere was this more apparent than his several collaborations with director Richard Linklater, with whom the actor most notably starred in ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), ""Waking Life"" (2001), ""Before Sunset"" (2004), ""Before Midnight"" (2013) and ""Boyhood"" (2014), which the actor and director had shot in pieces over the course of 12 years. Elsewhere, his films ranged from the commercially successful horror effort ""The Purge"" (2013) to more personal films like a biopic of troubled jazz trumpeter Chet Baker, ""Born to Be Blue"" (2015). Hawke did suffer the fate of most celebrities by landing in the tabloids for his widely publicized divorce with actress Uma Thurman after rumors of infidelity, but he continued to chart his own course on both stage and screen, making Hawke one of the more intriguing and unpredictable actors of his generation."

Without his manifesto for Generation X - who later were tagged with the sobriquet ""slackers"" - other independent filmmakers might not have been compelled to make their own movies, including Kevin Smith, who cited Linklater's movie as the key inspiration for making ""Clerks"" (1994). Linklater followed up with the classic cult comedy, ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993), which upped the ante for the young filmmaker. Though at this point he could have gone the studio route, Linklater instead chose to remain close to his indie roots with the dialogue-heavy ""Before Sunrise"" (1995), an engrossing romantic drama that showcased his growing maturity. He managed to repel a few fans with the dark and disturbing ""subUrbia"" (1996) and the more genre-oriented period crime drama ""The Newton Boys"" (1998), only to pull them back with ""Waking Life"" (2001), a groundbreaking film that used distinctive rotoscope animation over live action sequences. After the equally inspired ""Tape"" (2001), he directed the financial hit ""School of Rock"" (2003), before returning to familiar ground with the follow-up ""Before Sunset"" (2004). By the time he helmed ""Fast Food Nation"" (2006) and ""A Scanner Darkly"" (2006), Linklater had proven that he could balance the needs of commerce with his own unique creative impulses."

Her can-do energy was at the center of her career breakout as Annie, the spunky passenger on a runaway bus in ""Speed"" (1994), after which her endearing gutsiness and charm made her a romantic comedy favorite in films like ""While You Were Sleeping"" (1995) and ""Forces of Nature"" (1999). At her peak, she was so beloved that she gave even Julia Roberts a run for her money as box office queen. To prove her versatility, Bullock regularly detoured into serious dramas like ""Infamous"" (2006) and the occasional edge-of-your seat thriller like ""Premonition"" (2007) or the intense space drama ""Gravity"" (2012). But with the exception of the Academy Award-winning ""Crash"" (2002) and her Oscar-winning turn in ""The Blind Side"" (2009), the actress attracted the most fan devotion for sparkling in comedies like ""Miss Congeniality"" (2002) and ""The Heat"" (2013), where she lit up the screen with her quirky personality and earthy, approachable beauty. Seemingly impervious to  box-office disappointments and only more respected after a scandalous failed marriage, Bullock remained one of the most commercially viable and beloved actresses in American film."

Thanks to his newfound celebrity, Clooney made the jump to films while still on the series, quickly establishing himself as a major Hollywood player with leading roles in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996), ""Batman & Robin"" (1997) and ""Out of Sight"" (1998). When he left the confines of the small screen for big-screen pastures, Clooney transcended mere stardom to become one of the most prominent actors of his era, emulating the devil-may-care nonchalance of a Cary Grant or Clark Gable, while at the same time becoming an Academy Award-winning performer, risk-taking director, and socially-conscious activist. While raking at the box office as the breezy Danny Ocean in ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) and its two sequels, Clooney forged ahead on a directing career with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (2002). But it was his sophomore effort behind the camera, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" (2005), that catapulted the star into the realm of top-ranking filmmakers, thanks to a number of Academy Award nominations. Meanwhile, his Oscar-winning performance as a disillusioned CIA agent in ""Syriana"" (2005), a jaded executive in ""Up in the Air"" (2009), and a widowed father in ""The Descendants"" (2011) helped put to rest any residual notions that Clooney was just a famously devout bachelor out to have a good time. Films ranging from the science fiction drama ""Gravity"" (2013) to the Coen Brothers' Old Hollywood satire ""Hail Caesar!"" (2016) to action thriller ""Money Monster"" (2016) demonstrated his ever-widening range. As he matured as both an actor and an individual (including a high-profile 2014 marriage to British-Lebanese human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin and the birth of twins in June 2017), George Clooney became one of modern Hollywood's most old-school stars."

Despite the accolades, it took several years before the actor landed another memorable role, which finally came when he was cast in James Cameron's ambitious undersea adventure ""The Abyss"" (1989). Reaping the rewards of his new A-list status, Harris vacillated between literary character work in such acclaimed endeavors as ""Glengarry Glenn Ross"" (1992) and rousing crowd-pleasers like the NASA docudrama ""Apollo 13"" (1995). The versatile actor proved just as at home with pyrotechnic blockbusters like Michael Bay's actioner ""The Rock"" (1996) as he was in more heady material, such as the Jim Carrey vehicle ""The Truman Show"" (1998). Harris later astounded audiences as both the director and star of the enthralling biopic ""Pollock"" (2000), which he followed with equally heralded supporting work in the dramas ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001) and ""The Hours"" (2002). Incredibly dexterous, he played wildly divergent characters in the small town drama ""Empire Falls"" (HBO, 2005) and the shocking ""A History of Violence"" (2005). He returned to the director's chair once more to helm the sweeping western ""Appaloosa"" (2008), cementing his reputation as a deft cinematic storyteller.

Born in Mexico City, Mexico in 1981, CuarÃ³n hailed from a filmmaking family: his father directed such international hits as ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" (2001) and ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" (2004), while his uncle, Carlos CuarÃ³n, co-wrote ""Tambien"" and directed the independent feature ""Rudo y Cursi"" (2008). He lived in Mexico with his mother, actress Mariana Elizondo, until the age of 15, when he moved to New York to live with his father. CuarÃ³n became interested in film while attending Vassar College; there, he directed his first film, which took inspiration from Chris Marker's ""La JetÃ©e"" (1962) for its unusual structure of photographs edited into a narrative.  He then began his feature-length debut, ""Ano una"" (""Year of the Nail,"" 2007), as his senior thesis, but with his father's help, the project was expanded to 90 minutes in length and premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2007. CuarÃ³n's next project, ""The Shock Doctrine"" (2007), was a documentary short which attempted to link torture methods used by the CIA with political schemes to foment dissent in countries around the world. In 2013, CuarÃ³n and his father collaborated on the screenplay for the Oscar-winning drama ""Gravity,"" which earned them the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, among numerous other accolades. In addition to his writing duties, CuarÃ³n also wrote, director and produced ""Aningaaq"" (2014), a companion piece to ""Gravity"" which expands a scene in the film in which Sandra Bullock's stranded astronaut converses with an Inuit fisherman who intercepted one of her distress signal transmissions. The following year, CuarÃ³n co-wrote and directed ""Forsaken,"" a taut thriller with co-producer Gael Garcia Bernal as one of several Mexican immigrants stalked by a psychotic sniper (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) as they attempt to cross the Sonoran Desert. Co-produced by CuarÃ³n, his father and uncle, ""Desierto"" made its international debut at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival."

Inspired by real-life events and people, she explored the drug theme once again in her directorial film feature debut, ""Down to the Bone"" (2004), an indie gem that showcased Granik's deft use of realism and loose narrative. But it was her 2010 masterpiece, ""Winter's Bone,"" a harrowing yet beautifully shot drama about a strong-willed young woman coping with the cruelty of living in the Ozark Mountains that cast a spotlight on Granik's genius for the mainstream moviegoers, making her one of the most inspiring and compelling filmmakers of a new generation."

She easily made the jump to sound pictures and displayed her versatility in everything from the sizzling ""Red Dust"" (1932) to the elegant ""Dodsworth"" (1936) to the screwball classic ""Midnight"" (1939). However, she was truly indelible as the deceitful heroine of ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and gave an Oscar-winning barnstormer of a performance in ""The Great Lie"" (1941) that managed to overshadow the rarely dwarfed Bette Davis.

Huston led quite an adventurous life even before he began his Hollywood career, often recalling his days as a boxer, Mexican cavalry officer and avid horseback rider in many of his films. After a false start as a screenwriter in the early days of talkies, Huston re-emerged in the late-1930s as a successful contract writer who penned such hits as ""The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"" (1938), ""Sergeant York"" (1941) and ""High Sierra"" (1941). During this time, he developed a strong working collaboration with Humphrey Bogart, who became a major star following his turn in Huston's directorial debut, ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), one of the best film noirs ever made. The two had even greater success with ""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"" (1948), which earned Huston and his father, actor Walter Huston, Academy Awards. From there, the director entered into what became his most fruitful period, helming such long-held classics as ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950), ""The Red Badge of Courage"" (1951) and ""The African Queen"" (1952), which delivered Bogie his only Oscar. He also began acting later in his career, turning in an acclaimed supporting performance in ""The Cardinal"" (1963) while being best remembered for his portrayal of the vile Noah Cross in ""Chinatown"" (1974). In the last decade of his life, Huston returned to critical and box office prominence with ""Prizzi's Honor"" (1985), which earned daughter Anjelica an Academy Award, making the Hustons the first family to win Oscars in three successive generations.

Establishing himself as a short story writer in the pages of the mystery magazine Black Mask in the early 1920s, Hammett enjoyed great success with the publication of his first three novels by the end of the decade. Fame took him to Hollywood where film adaptations of ""The Thin Man"" (1934), ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) and ""The Glass Key"" (1942), made Hammett a household name and a wealthy man. Sadly, the end of the author's writing career virtually coincided with the height of his fame. After being blacklisted by Hollywood and spending several months in prison due to his left-leaning politics in 1951, the chronically ill Hammett spent his remaining years in the care of revered playwright Lillian Hellman, his on-again, off-again companion for 30 years. Long after his death, Hammett's influence could be seen in the works of such acclaimed filmmakers as Akira Kurosawa, Sergio Leone and the Coen Brothers, as well as novelists like Ross Macdonald and James Ellroy. A subject of great interest, Hammett himself was portrayed in the films ""Julia"" (1977) and ""Hammett"" (1982).

The majority of his roles have been in action movies and dramas, and he is probably best known for his role as gunner and assassin Ghost in the science fiction movies ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions."" Besides being an expert weapons specialist, Ghost is known for his stoicism, his knowledge of philosophy, and for his cool efficiency in taking out the enemy. He is also in love with Trinity. The character is featured in the video game ""Enter the Matrix."" Wong set out to be a journalist after college, but his love for acting won out. He landed early roles playing a martial arts fighter on an Australian children's show and roles in a ""The Saint"" television movie and the revamped ""Mission: Impossible"" television series in the late 1980s. The actor feared typecasting, however, and desperately wanted more challenging parts. He also landed major roles in the Australian television programs ""Spellbinder: Land of the Dragon"" and ""Home and Away."" Post-""Matrix,"" Wong auditioned for several Hollywood productions, subsequently nabbing parts in the remake ""Flight of the Phoenix,"" in an episode of ""Glee,"" and in the Steven Soderbergh action movie ""Haywire,"" to name just a few productions."

After a few Aussie TV roles in his youth, he appeared briefly in the sci-fi sequel ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) and became intent on writing his own film with Wan. The result was the bloody and unexpected hit ""Saw,"" which made a huge return on its small budget, prompting a slew of sequels. Whannell co-penned ""Saw II"" (2005) and ""Saw III"" (2006) and served as an executive producer on the films. He later moved on to co-writing ""Dead Silence"" (2007) with Wan, but the movie wasn't successful critically or commercially. In 2010, Whannell and his go-to collaborator reunited for the supernatural film ""Insidious."" The eerie and unsettling tale, which featured Whannell as a paranormal investigator's assistant, was a huge hit. In 2013, he returned for ""Insidious: Chapter 2,"" which was well received, and once again showcased his clear talents as both a screenwriter and supporting actor."

From there, Ejiofor was able to carve out an impressive career in a short amount of time, though most audiences would have been hard-pressed to place the name or face. But he did earn high critical praise, particularly for his low-key performance in Stephen Frears' gritty urban drama, ""Dirty Pretty Things"" (2002). Though he earned several small awards for the role, Ejiofor remained a relative unknown in the United States. He sought to change that with roles in the popular British romantic comedy ""Love Actually"" (2003), Woody Allen's tragicomedy ""Melinda and Melinda"" (2004), and by playing a sassy drag queen in ""Kinky Boots"" (2005), which earned him his first Golden Globe nomination. Ejiofor graduated to bigger studio films, supporting Denzel Washington in both ""Inside Man"" (2006) and ""American Gangster"" (2007), while delivering a fine turn as the leader of a rebel group in the dystopian thriller ""Children of Men"" (2006), all of which illustrated that it was only a matter of time before he became a household name."

Born in Heidelberg, Germany, he moved with his parents as a toddler to Killarney, Ireland where he was raised. He made his screen debut in the show ""Hearts and Bones"" (BBC One, 2000-01). He earned a role in the Tom Hanks-produced World War II miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" (HBO, 2001). He continued working steadily for the rest of the decade in television on both sides of the Atlantic. He began gaining notice on film with a role as a Spartan in Zack Snyder's ""300"" (2006). He starred as imprisoned IRA leader Bobby Sands in Steve McQueen's feature debut ""Hunger"" (2008). Quentin Tarantino cast him as a British officer who can speak German in his alternative history WWII epic ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009), a role that brought him to the attention of the general public. He joined Josh Brolin for the comic book film ""Jonah Hex"" (2010), and played Rochester in an adaptation of ""Jane Eyre"" (2011). Fassbender stepped into superhero lore when he played Erik Lensherr in ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011). The character is the basis for super villain Magneto, who had been played in previous ""X-Men"" films by Ian McKellen. Both actors would play old and young versions of the character in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014). Fassbender would step into Magneto's helmet for two more films ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016) and ""Dark Phoenix"" (2019). Apart from the mutant franchise, he starred in Ridley Scott's sci-fi epic ""Prometheus"" (2012). He also played a brutal slave owner in McQueen's Academy Award-winning drama ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013), earning a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He would score another nomination, this time for Best Actor, for ""Steve Jobs"" (2015), playing the Apple founder. Insead of comics, he transitioned to video game films, playing the lead in the big screen rendering of the popular game ""Assassin's Creed"" (2016). Scott cast him again in his space thriller ""Alien: Covenant"" (2017). He also starred in ""The Snowman"" (2017), playing Harry Hole, the detective from Jo Nesbo's mystery novels.

Following attention-grabbing turns in films like ""L.I.E.""

His performance as the good-hearted, but withdrawn Dwayne was singled out by critics, allowing him to expand his horizons. He did just that when he delivered an excellent supporting performance as a fire-and-brimstone preacher opposite Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis in ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007). Dano went on to voice Alexander in ""Where the Wild Things Are"" (2009), before playing a variety of off-beat characters in a string of indies like ""Gigantic"" (2008), ""Taking Woodstock"" (2009), ""The Good Heart"" (2009) and ""The Extra Man"" (2010). Not one to be pigeonholed, Dano entered the blockbuster arena with supporting roles in ""Knight and Day"" (2010) and ""Cowboys & Aliens"" (2011). He returned to the indie fold as the star of co-star, writer and girlfriend Zoe Kazan's much-buzzed about romantic comedy ""Ruby Sparks"" (2012), which further demonstrated Dano's ability to continually surprise critics and fans with his diversity of choices."

A graduate of New York University's prestigious theater school, Dillahunt paid his dues in the proverbial trenches of the acting world, including live theater, soaps, some recurring roles on forgettable sitcoms and the odd indie film, before delivering a breakthrough performance on the Showtime series, ""Leap Years"" (2001-02). Producer David Milch would give Dillahunt's talents their biggest showcase then to date on ""Deadwood,"" where the actor played two successive characters, both scurrilous scoundrels yet both so distinct that even diehard viewers failed to notice it was the same actor. He went on to stand out in turns as a Terminator in ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" (Fox, 2008-09) and a violent sociopath in the 2009 feature remake of ""Last House On the Left,"" becoming a specialist in ultra-creepy villains. Still, he would defy typecasting, winning critical praise as a dryly funny pool-cleaning dad on the quirky Fox comedy series ""Raising Hope"" (2010-14) and winning indie film leads in John Sayles' feature ""Amigo"" (2010) and the dark suspense thriller ""Oliver Sherman"" (2010).

Giamatti first grabbed the public's attention with his vitriolic performance as Kenny - a.k.a. Pig Vomit - Howard Stern's nemesis in ""Private Parts"" (1997), before quickly developing into the go-to guy for a director looking for an everyman-type actor who could convincingly project simmering intensity. His sour yet endearing performance as bitter comic book writer Harvey Pekar in the offbeat biopic, ""American Splendor"" (2003) did much to put him on the mainstream moviegoer's radar. But it was with his highly-lauded performance in the surprise hit ""Sideways"" (2004), that Giamatti vaulted to the A-list as a kind of unlikely leading man, a leap that made the comfortable character actor a bit unsettled. With award-worthy performances in ""John Adams"" (HBO, 2008) and ""Barney's Version"" (2010), Giamatti became one of those rare actors capable of excelling in both leading and supporting roles, allowing him the freedom to oscillate between big budget fare and small indie films, while developing a reputation as one of the most mesmerizing performers of his time."

Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, McNairy (who was given the nickname ""Scoot"" as a child because he'd scoot around a lot on his behind) began acting at a very young age. He appeared in plays in local theater companies throughout his hometown, and dreamt of one day making a living as a film and television actor. His dream stayed with him throughout his teens, and after moving to Austin in his early 20s, McNairy nabbed his first acting role in the film ""Wrong Numbers"" (2001). Being on a film set for the first time was an incredibly inspiring experience for McNairy, and shortly after he moved to Los Angeles to study cinematography at film school. He dropped out after a year, however, after deciding that his true motivation was to act. While pursuing a career in acting, McNairy took whatever odd jobs he could find, including extra work and building movie sets. He began landing work in the early 2000s with parts in films like ""Wonderland"" (2003), ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" (2005), and ""Art School Confidential"" (2006). He continued working steadily throughout the decade. By the early 2010s, McNairy began appearing in prestige films like ""Argo,"" ""12 Years a Slave,"" and ""Gone Girl"" (2014) - all three of which either won an Oscar, or were nominated for an Academy Award. Then in 2014 McNairy landed the role of Gordon Clark on the AMC series ""Halt and Catch Fire"" (AMC, 2014-17). He appeared in all 40 episodes of the acclaimed series, which only raised McNairy's acting profile. After his part on ""Halt and Catch Fire"" ended, McNairy continued making a name for himself on television. In addition to nabbing roles in ""Godless"" and the third season of ""True Detective"" (HBO, 2014- ), he also narrated the Netflix series ""Narcos: Mexico"" (Netflix, 2018- ). That series, which served as a companion show to the hugely popular historical drama ""Narcos"" (Netflix, 2015-17), premiered on the streaming service in November of 2018.

The daughter of Nigerian immigrants who struggled to provide for a large family in New York City, Oduye put her own dreams aside to fulfill her father's wish that his children pursue medical careers. Yet it was also her father's unexpected death that made Oduye realize that life was too short not to pursue her true passion - acting. After getting her feet wet in the industry with appearances in student films, theater workshops and short features, Oduye gained career momentum with a minor role in the independent drama ""Half Nelson"" (2006). The following year, she landed a life-changing role of a young, gay outcast in writer-director Dee Rees' short ""Pariah"" (2007).

Paulson began showcasing her abilities on the small screen and had her breakthrough role on the cult series ""American Gothic"" (CBS, 1995-98). After entering the feature world, she landed her second major series with the comedic drama ""Jack & Jill"" (The WB, 1999-2001), while making further strides in movies with ""Held Up"" (1999) and ""What Women Want"" (2000). She went on to supporting turns in dramas like ""Path to War"" (HBO, 2002) and lighthearted fare like ""Down With Love"" (2003), before turning in a fine performance as an undercover Pinkerton agent on ""Deadwood"" (HBO, 2004-05). From there, Paulson was catapulted to stardom as one of the critically acclaimed stars on the high-profile, but short-lived drama ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" (NBC, 2006-07). At the same time, she made brief tabloid news where her partner, Cherry Jones, inadvertently outed her in a Tony Awards acceptance speech. Meanwhile, Paulson's career continued unabated with a string of guest starring roles and an acclaimed supporting turn in ""Game Change"" (HBO, 2012) before becoming a fixture on the acclaimed anthology series ""American Horror Story"" (FX 2011- ).

Though originally slated to be on the show for seven episodes - the writers said they wanted to kill off Omar in season one - Williams instilled his character with a magnetic charm and sense of humor that elevated him beyond anything the creators envisioned. Prior to his star turn on ""The Wire,"" Williams was seen in supporting parts on television and in film, mostly as street thugs and drug dealers; roles he got, thanks in part, to a long facial scar received in a bar fight.

After graduating, Chalk began pursuing a professional career on both the stage and the screen, eventually landing a small role in the movie adaptation of the musical ""Rent"" (2005), though his appearance would last for only eight seconds. After starring in ""Defiance"" at the Manhattan Theatre Club City Center in 2006 and in an acclaimed Broadway production of ""Fences"" in 2010, Chalk landed the recurring role of Tom Walker on the phenomenally popular series ""Homeland"" (Showtime, 2011-) in 2011.

Born on April Fool's Day 1982 and raised in a small town near San Bernadino, CA, Killan made his film debut in 1994 in a small role in ""The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult."" In 2001, at the age of 19, he joined the cast of Fox's ""MADtv"" for one season. While studying with improv troupe The Groundlings in Los Angeles, Killam made guest appearances on a handful of comedy and variety series, including ""All That"" (Nickelodeon 1994-2005) and its spinoff, the Amanda Bynes vehicle ""The Amanda Show"" (Nickelodeon 1999-2002). He also had a small part in the Ashton Kutcher romantic comedy ""Just Married"" (2003).  In 2005, Killam had a key role in a fascinating TV misfire called ""Nobody's Watching."" Created by writer/producer Bill Lawrence, the show was conceived as a meta-sitcom, in which two TV-obsessed young men, Derrick (Killam) and Will (Paul Campbell) are followed by a reality-TV camera crew as they try to write and produce their own sitcom. A pilot was produced for The WB, but the network declined after focus groups reacted negatively. But when the show appeared on YouTube the following year, it found enough fans to get a series of web-only episodes bankrolled by NBC in 2006-07. As part of the ongoing conceit of the series, Killam and Campbell appeared in character as background actors on a number of NBC series during this period, including ""Days of Our Lives"" (NBC 1965- ) and Lawrence's own ""Scrubs"" (NBC 2001-08 / ABC 2009-2010). Killam returned to sketch comedy as a cast member on the improv show ""Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out"" (MTV 2005-07) and its more conventional sketch-based spinoff ""Nick Cannon Presents: Short Circuitz"" (MTV 2007). In 2006, Killam began an occasional recurring role on the sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother"" (CBS 2005-2014) as Blauman, an obnoxious co-worker of Barney (Neil Patrick Harris). While working on that show, Killam met and began dating actress Cobie Smulders, who played the leading role of Robin Scherbatsky. The couple had a daughter, Shaelyn Cado Killam, in 2009, and got married in 2012. In 2010, Killam joined the cast of ""Saturday Night Live"" as a featured player alongside fellow new faces Vanessa Bayer, Paul Brittan and Jay Pharoah. Killam's boyish charisma made him an immediate standout among the new cast members. He proved adept at celebrity impersonations (including a dead-on skewering of Michael Cera's twee mannerisms in co-star Abby Elliott's recurring sketch ""Gettin' Quirky With Zooey Deschanel""), and his original material had an oddball charm of its own. For example, his nearly wordless recurring sketch ""Les Jeunes de Paris"" consisted of cast members dancing madly to French pop songs on a set decorated like a nouvelle vague film of the early 1960s. Killam was promoted to the show's main cast at the start of the 38th season in 2012. The following year, Killam got his first major film role, as a disgruntled DEA agent in the Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy buddy comedy ""The Heat"" (2013).  Between seasons of SNL, Killam appeared in small roles in films ranging from the comedy sequel ""Grown Ups 2"" (2013) and ""Teenage Mutant Ninaja Turtles"" (2014) to Oscar-winner ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). He also appeared as himself in a cameo in ""Ted 2"" (2015) and starred in the educational animated series ""Nature Cat"" (PBS Kids 2015- ) in the title role. In August 2016, it was announced that Killam would not be returning to ""Saturday Night Live"" for his seventh season, in part because he was busy directing and co-starring in the action comedy ""Why We're Killing Gunther"" (2017) with Arnold Schwarzenegger."

Known as someone who fearlessly inhabits his roles, Camp's first onscreen credit was a bit part in ""Reversal of Fortune"" (1990). Camp continuously worked in theater, playing in Off-Broadway performances of ""The Seagull"" and ""Measure for Measure,"" and occasionally appearing in films like ""In & Out"" (1997) or in guest roles on series like ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010). After spending over a year away from acting, Camp returned to the stage in Tony Kushner's play ""Homebody/Kabul,"" which earned him an Obie Award in 2002. Camp's profile began to expand on screen, as well, with roles in ""Public Enemies"" (2009), ""Lincoln"" (2012), and ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013), amongst others.

Following the show's brief 12-episode run, Scott worked sporadically in Hollywood over the next two decades, including a role in the college drama ""Chocolate City"" (1994), while concentrating on her schooling and appearing in regional theatre productions and a touring company of the Broadway hit ""Dreamgirls."" After graduating from Florida A&M University's School of Journalism and Graphic Communication, followed by a master's from Florida State University's College of Motion Picture Arts, Scott moved to Los Angeles to once again pursue her show business dreams. After time spent as a script consultant for a number of production companies, Scott created the first screenwriting curriculum at Golden West College in Orange County, CA, at the age of 25. One of her scripts was filmed as ""Motives"" (2004), starring Vivica A. Fox. It proved successful enough to spawn a 2007 sequel which Scott once again penned, with Fox reprising her role. 2009 began a resurgence of work for Scott on-camera, as she began working in a variety of indie films and television series, while she also worked on her own web series ""Hollywood Girl"" (2010). The program gave Scott a chance to truly stretch her creative wings, as she worked as writer, director, producer and even camera operator on various episodes over the next three years. Scott's mainstream breakthrough came with Steve McQueen's powerful ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013). Having originally read for a smaller role, she instead co-starred opposite Chiwetel Ejiofor as Anne Northrup, the wife of a black man sold into slavery in the Antebellum United States."

Just five at the time of the audition, Wallis claimed she was the minimum required age of six.

A devotee of the nouvelle vague style of the 1960s French New Wave, McQueen started his film career off with a series of experimental shorts exhibited in an unusual fashion, including screening without sound and/or on multiple art gallery walls rather than a conventional screen. Known for his meticulous sense of detail and guarded personality, McQueen maintained that his work was apolitical, though this was disputed, given its implied criticism of how the British government treated Irish Republican Army prisoners and displayed reluctance to suitably honor military personnel killed during the Iraq war. One of the few artists to garner instant acclaim upon transitioning to feature films, McQueen's ""Hunger"" (2008) and ""Shame"" (2011) - both starring Michael Fassbender - were heralded for their quiet, refined power and McQueen was cited as one of Britain's most promising and creative directors. This early promise was met in ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013), a harrowing period drama that won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for McQueen."

Ridley was born in 1965 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He first started off as a writer for the hit sitcoms ""Martin"" (Fox 1992-97) and ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" (NBC 1990-96), after which he served as both a writer and co-producer of the critically-acclaimed ""The John Larroquette Show"" (NBC 1993-96). Audiences next saw Ridley's first foray into feature films, ""Cold Around the Heart"" (1997) which starred David Caruso and Chris Noth. Ridley then wrote a script about American soldiers out to look for gold bullion at the end of the Persian Gulf War, which director David O. Russell adapted into the film ""Three Kings"" (1999), starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, reportedly without using any of Ridley's original script, which caused a feud between writer and director. Ridley continued to write for television, including his own original series ""Platinum"" (UPN 2003), the film adaptation ""Barbershop"" (Showtime 2005) and ""The Wanda Sykes Show"" (Fox 2009-2010); he also served as executive producer of the latter two shows. Ridley's career reached new heights when he was tasked to write the screenplay for ""12 Years a Slave,"" a film adaptation of Solomon Northup's memoir that chronicled the story of how he was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the mid-19th century. The film was universally praised by critics and Ridley himself garnered numerous awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay at the 86th Academy Awards. Ridley made his directorial debut the following year with ""Jimi: All Is By My Side"" (2014), a film starring Andre Benjamin of the hip hop duo Outkast as rock legend Jimi Hendrix, portraying him in 1966 just prior to his international breakthrough. Despite critical acclaim for Benjamin's performance, the film was met with general disinterest at the box office.

Although the first chapter of the company's tenure was spent developing small commercial and documentary projects, 2005 saw the beginnings of Pohlad's influence in the realm of prestige pictures. Starting with Oscar nominee Brokeback Mountain, Pohlad went on to produce a string of high profile films, most recently the esteemed Best Picture winner 12 Years a Slave.

Stockhausen first served as an art director during his early Hollywood years, racking up credits on comedy drama ""Ash Tuesday"" (2003), Jude Law remake ""Alfie"" (2004) and the new version of ""The Producers"" (2005), where he was taken under the wing of acclaimed production designer Mark Friedberg. The pair went onto rebuild an entire Indian Railways train on ""The Darjeeling Limited"" (2007), the first of several Wes Anderson films that Stockhausen would play a vital role in.

Born in Los Angeles, California in 1974, DiCaprio began acting as a small child, appearing in commercials. His first major TV role came in 1990 when he joined the cast of the sitcom ""Growing Pains"" (ABC, 1985-1992) as Luke, a homeless boy taken in by the Seaver family. The young actor's star power was immediately evident, and it was not long before Robert De Niro handpicked DiCaprio to co-star with him in the feature film ""This Boy's Life"" (1993). DiCaprio earned strong reviews for his performance, and he won even more acclaim for his portrayal of a young man living with a mental disability in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" (1993) that same year. DiCaprio's simultaneous status as both a prodigious actor and teen heartthrob climbed higher as he co-starred with Claire Danes in Baz Lurman's unusual adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Romeo + Juliet"" (1996), but it inarguably reached a zenith when he paired with Kate Winslet for the romantic blockbuster ""Titanic"" (1997) the following year. Now commanding the ability to work on virtually any project he wished, DiCaprio took the opportunity to make some smaller, more artistically minded films including Woody Allen's ""Celebrity"" (1998), and to begin using his fame and wealth to further environmental causes-a passion that would prove nearly equal to his drive as an actor. However, when it came time to choose his next major, big-budget project, DiCaprio's choice proved to be pivotal, as he teamed with famed director Martin Scorsese for the first time on the period drama ""Gangs of New York"" (2002). He also starred in Ron Howard's hit biopic of young con man Frank Abignale Jr. in ""Catch Me if You Can"" (2002) that same year, but DiCaprio's creative partnership with Scorsese would remain a vital force in his career for years to come. They worked together two years later on ""The Aviator"" (2004), which found DiCaprio portraying famed tycoon Howard Hughes, and again the following year on the highly acclaimed crime drama ""The Departed"" (2005). Just over a decade after ""Titanic"" and its epic success, DiCaprio joined co-star Kate Winslet again for a near thematic inversion of their previous film in the tortured marriage drama ""Revolutionary Road"" (2008). Quickly thereafter, DiCaprio returned to his partnership with Scorsese for the Hitchcock-esque ""Shutter Island"" (2010). His next major project was Christopher Nolan's hit mind-bending drama ""Inception"" (2010). Then in 2012, a last-minute conflict with another actor left an unexpected opening in Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" (2012). This happy accident led to DiCaprio portraying the villainous Calvin Candie in the film-a happenstance that would later prove fortuitous for both actor and director. However, DiCaprio first reteamed with Baz Lurman for the title role in the glittery  ""The Great Gatsby"" (2013) and with Scorsese for the criminal biopic ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013), not to mention win worldwide acclaim for his role in the wilderness survival film ""The Revenant"" (2015), before his small but memorable appearance in ""Django Unchained"" bore dividends. This moment finally came in 2019, when Tarantino asked DiCaprio to star in his film about the '60s film industry and the infamous Manson murders, ""Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood"" (2019). Co-starring with Brad Pitt as a washed-up actor and his charming stuntman respectively, both the film and DiCaprio's performance in it proved to be a major cultural sensation."

Born with crystal blue eyes and model good looks, the Australian-born actress rose to prominence with roles that highlighted her physical beauty, such as Donna Freedman in the long-running soap opera ""Neighbors"" (Seven Network 1985, Network Ten 1986-2010, Eleven 2011- ) and sexually tantalizing trophy wife Naomi Lapaglia in Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013), before breaking through as the near-psychotic Harley Quinn in the DC Comics blockbuster ""Suicide Squad"" (2016). Robbie was born on July 2, 1990 in the Gold Coast of Australia, where she spent much of her childhood at her grandparents' farm. After graduating from Somerset College in 2007, she began pursuing her acting career. Her first big break came when she starred in two Australian features, ""Vigilante"" (2008) and ""I.C.U."" (2009). Robbie then used the opportunity to audition for one of Australia's biggest soap operas, ""Neighbors."" Despite having thought she auditioned poorly, the show nevertheless wanted her to jump in for a guest character, an obsessed fan of Ty Harper (Dean Geyer) named Donna Freedman. However, she proved to be a terrific fit for the show and turned her character into a show regular. Robbie's startling physical beauty launched her into stardom in Australia, and she was nominated twice for a Logie Award for her performance as Donna Freedman. From 2008 to 2011, Robbie was a fan favorite on the show and ultimately left the show to pursue her dreams of Hollywood. Her first step of conquering Tinseltown came in 2011, when she was cast in the early '60s period piece drama ""Pan Am"" (ABC 2011-12). Robbie joined the show as part of an all-female lead cast who portrayed stewardesses of the iconic airline. Despite heavy promotion from ABC, the show was cancelled after just one season. However, she gained tremendous exposure for her next big project, ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio as real-life stock swindler Jordan Belfort. Robbie played Belfort's wife Naomi Lapaglia. She followed that well-received film with starring roles in science fiction thriller ""Z for Zacariah"" (2015) and twisty con-artist romantic comedy ""Focus"" (2015), opposite Will Smith. After small roles in World War II romance ""Suite FranÃ§aise"" (2015) and Adam McKay's real estate drama ""The Big Short"" (2015), Robbie reteamed with ""Focus"" directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, co-starring opposite Tina Fey in war zone comedy-drama ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" (2016). The same year, Robbie starred in a pair of highly anticipated summer blockbusters, portraying Jane Porter in ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (2016) and psychotic antihero Harley Quinn in DC Comics thrill ride ""Suicide Squad"" (2016). The latter proved to be her mainstream breakthrough, as her showy role as the one-time psychologist turned girlfriend/victim of The Joker proved the film's most compelling performance. Robbie celebrated her mainstream breakthrough by hosting the 42nd season premiere of ""Saturday Night Live"" (NBC 1975- ) in October 2016."

Having partnered with director John Carpenter, he next essayed one of his most enduring characters, Snake Plissken, the antihero of Carpenter's cult classic ""Escape from New York"" (1981). Russell delivered another solid performance as memorable hard-case R.J. MacReady in Carpenter's gory remake of ""The Thing"" (1982). While making the troubled romantic comedy ""Swing Shift"" (1984), Russell became romantically involved with co-star Goldie Hawn, with whom he forged a lasting partnership that resembled a marriage, but without the actual legal certificate. He was even considered by Hawn's two children from a previous marriage, actors Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson, to be - at least in spirit - their father. Meanwhile, Russell thrived throughout the 1980s with ""Big Trouble in Little China"" (1986) and ""Tequila Sunrise"" (1988), which carried over into the next decade with ""Backdraft"" (1991), ""Captain Ron"" (1992) and a dead-on portrayal of Wyatt Earp in ""Tombstone"" (1993). Following box office success with ""Stargate"" (1994) and ""Executive Decision"" (1996), Russell offered up varied performances in films like the tense thriller ""Breakdown"" (1997), Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001), hockey drama ""Miracle"" (2004), and Quentin Tarantino's ""Grindhouse"" (2007) and ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015).

Hirsch followed up by co-starring opposite Penn in ""Milk"" (2008), Gus Van Sant's Oscar-winning biopic about slain San Francisco politician and openly gay activist, Harvey Milk. He took a few steps back with a starring role in the critical and commercial flop ""Speed Racer"" (2008), and was virtually off the map in little-seen films like ""Taking Woodstock"" (2009) and ""The Darkest Hour"" (2011). Working with such venerated directors as William Friedkin and Oliver Stone, Hirsch attempted a course correction with offerings like ""Killer Joe"" (2012) and ""Savages"" (2012). One of the most committed and promising young talents of his generation, Hirsch consistently impressed with each new role."

Shortly afterward, Perry landed a starring role in the teen drama series ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" (Fox 1999-2000), on which he played the moody Dylan McKay, the role for which he would always be best known.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, he grew up outside St. Paul, Minnesota. Following an interest fueled by action movies and video games, the 12 year-old Moh took quickly to taekwondo and became a black belt after only two years of study. When Moh was a business student at the University of Minnesota, he continued to train and teach as well as travel to demonstrate taekwondo. His skills caught the attention of a casting director recruiting martial artists for Jackie Chan, and he was soon in Hong Kong to work with the Jackie Chan Stunt Team on the film ""Robin-B-Hood"" (2006). His next major work was as one of the Riders in ""Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight"" (The CW, 2008-09). Moh focused on stunt work when he was stunt double for the lead actor on ""Supah Ninjas"" (Nickelodeon, 2011-13). He had his most exposure, and got to live out a childhood dream, when he played Ryu on the web series ""Street Fighter: Assassins Fist"" (Machinima, 2014). In his first substantial role without a martial arts component, Moh landed a recurring role on ""Empire"" (Fox, 2015-), and in 2017 he was cast as Triton, one of the lead characters on the Marvel series ""Inhumans"" (ABC, 2017-)."

Uninhibited. Unflappable. All of these capture just a fraction of the complexity of Lena Dunham, the creative force behind the groundbreaking cable series ""Girls"" (HBO, 2012-17). Born with the help of Hollywood heavyweight Judd Apatow, the high-profile show centered on four twenty-somethings living, working and struggling in Brooklyn. But the collective love and outcry of an Internet's worth of critics and detractors was nothing new for the multi-hyphenate, self-described ""voice of a generation."" After writing, directing and starring in the satirical Internet series ""Delusional Downtown Divas"" (2009), she drew on her own college experiences for her debut film ""Creative Nonfiction"" (2009), which was showcased in the Emerging Visions section of South by Southwest. Her follow-up, the full-length feature ""Tiny Furniture"" (2010), fleshed out Dunham's style of abrasively confessional drama that had quickly become her trademark. Then came ""Girls,"" and the $3.5 million book deal, and the debates over her nonchalant approach to female sexuality. And soon, the eyes of the generation that her character professed to speak for (and a few others, as well) were all on her. Throughout the occasional controversies, she continued working, not just on her own show, but in films ranging from ""This Is 40"" (2012) to Mike Birbiglia's ""Don't Think Twice"" (2016)."

Trained at the prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Birmingham Repertory Company, Lewis gained prominence in the U.S. with an utterly convincing performance as a stalwart G.I. in the heralded miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" (HBO, 2001). Unfortunately, his first leading role in a major motion picture, the bizarre adaptation of Stephen King's ""Dreamcatcher"" (2003), failed to carry the momentum. Regardless of the material, Lewis' performances were always given high marks and before long he was cast as the star of the well-regarded crime-drama series ""Life"" (NBC, 2007-09). Although the Writers Guild of America strike of 2007 had a devastating impact on the short-lived show, the actor found more small screen success a few years later alongside Claire Danes in the thriller series ""Homeland"" (Showtime, 2011- ). His perfomance as the troubled Nicholas Brody, who may or may not be an Al-Qaida operative, brought the actor an Emmy for Best Actor. Whether portraying one of Shakespeare's classic characters or a modern American hero, Lewis could be counted on to elevate any project he chose to participate in."

As a genre star, Dern was most recognizable for his committed turns in lower quality but vivid productions including the mad scientist film ""The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant"" (1971), the sci-fi proto-environmental picture ""Silent Running"" (1972), and the deranged mastermind behind a blimp bombing of the Super Bowl in ""Black Sunday"" (1977). Other notable film work included ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" (1969), ""Support Your Local Sheriff!"" (1969), and his infamous turn as a cattle rustler who kills John Wayne in ""The Cowboys"" (1972). He garnered award recognition as the spoiled Tom Buchanan in ""The Great Gatsby"" (1974) and as a disillusioned Vietnam vet in ""Coming Home"" (1978). The ex-husband of fellow actor Diane Ladd and the father of actress Laura Dern, he continued to book roles into later age, including a chilling turn as the domineering father of polygamist Bill (Bill Paxton) on ""Big Love"" (HBO, 2006-2011) and a former Confederate general in Quentin Tarantino's ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015). Although he never fully broke out of his typecasting as a genre heavy, Bruce Dern proved he possessed impressive enough acting chops to build a long-lasting career."
1698,Timothy Olyphant,5/20/1968,"Honolulu, Hawaii, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/2ZdX7BhdJT30tRNK2mWbT9JHAPo=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/164843_v9_bb.jpg,"Adept at both comedy and intense, dramatic action, Timothy Olyphant was an eclectic but appealing presence in two highly-regarded series - ""Deadwood"" (HBO, 2004-06) and ""Justified"" (FX, 2010-15) - and an inveterate scene-stealer in films and series like ""Go"" (1999), ""Damages"" (FX Network/Audience Network, 2007-2012) and ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007). Born Timothy David Olyphant on May 20, 1968 in Honolulu, Hawaii, he moved with his family - Gallo wine executive J.V. Bevan Olyphant, his wife, Katherine and two brothers - to Modesto, California when he was two years of age. There, he nurtured an interest in competitive swimming at Fred C. Beyer High School, and considered a career in art. Olyphant was recruited to the University of Southern California by its swimming coach, but upon discovering that he would be unable to swim and pursue his chosen major- architecture - he chose to earn his degree in fine arts. Upon graduating in 1990, he married his college sweetheart, Alexis Knief, and the pair relocated to New York, where Olyphant dabbled in coaching and stand-up comedy before abandoning fine art in favor of an acting career. After completing a two-year course of study at the William Esper Studio, he began landing minor roles on television series and in features like ""Sex and the City"" (HBO, 1998-2004) and ""Scream 2"" (1997). His first break came as a drug-dealing anti-hero in Doug Liman's edgy comedy-drama ""Go"" (1999), which in turn led to an offer from its producer, Mickey Liddell, to star in ""The Broken Hearts Club"" (2000), a romantic comedy about gay men in West Hollywood, California. Response to the film set the template for much of Olyphant's film output in the next few years: Olyphant's slyly bemused performances was, more often than not, the sole bright spot in indie and studio efforts like ""Auggie Rose"" (2000); ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" (2000), with Nicolas Cage; ""Head Over Heels"" (2001); ""Rock Star"" (2001) with Mark Wahlberg, and ""The Girl Next Door"" (2004). That same year, Olyphant received one of his best showcases in ""Deadwood,"" producer David Milch's proudly profane and intricately plotted Western series about the lives of real and imagined individuals in the notorious titular South Dakota mining camp. Olyphant played Seth Bullock, the hot-tempered but law-abiding camp sheriff, whose notions of right and wrong often ran afoul of Ian McShane's Machiavellian saloonkeeper, Al Swearengen. A critical favorite for Milch's ornate dialogue and cast of accomplished players, ""Deadwood"" was only a modest ratings hit, and the cost of maintaining an entire town set led to its untimely demise after two seasons. But even with the abbreviated run, the attention afforded by critics and industry figures to ""Deadwood"" helped to boost Olyphant's profile from comic support to dramatic lead and co-lead, which in turn led to major roles in a slew of motion pictures. The most successful of these was undoubtedly ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007), whch cast him as a cyber-terrorist pitted against Bruce Willis' reluctant hero, but as before, Olyphant was the most notable element of films like ""Hitman"" (2007), which afforded him a rare lead; ""The Perfect Getaway"" (2009); ""The Crazies"" (2010) and ""Elektra Luxx"" (2010). Olyphant was soon back on television, where he played Rose Byrne's highly suspect boyfriend in the second season of ""Damages,"" and a brief run as a handsome paper salesman on several episodes of ""The Office"" (NBC, 2005-2013). His performance on ""Damages"" led to network chief John Landgraf offering him the lead on ""Justified,"" a crime thriller based on Elmore Leonard's stories about a flinty U.S. Marshal. The series helped to do what ""Deadwood"" had promised - to provide Olyphant with a long-running and high-quality showcase for his talents, which earned a Emmy nomination in 2011. When ""Justified"" ran its course after five seasons, Olyphant bounced between comic and dramatic efforts: the former included an amusing turn as a vain, fictionalized version of himself on ""The Grinder"" (Fox, 2015-16) and a series lead in the Netflix dark comedy ""The Santa Clarita Diet"" (2017-19), with Olyphant as a suburban husband attempting to contend with his wife (Drew Barrymore), who has transformed into a cannibalistic zombie. In 2019, long-standing rumors of a ""Deadwood"" revival finally materialized as a two-hour TV-movie for HBO, with Olyphant reprising his role as an older, slightly less irascible Bullock."

Prior to working with Tarantino, Bell performed stunts in her native New Zealand on popular syndicated shows like ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" (1995-2001) and ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" (1995-99). Upon her arrival in Hollywood, however, she faced a steep uphill battle against sexism, which was showcased in Amada Micheli's excellent documentary ""Double Dare"" (2004). At the time, Bell did stunt work for Tarantino on ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" (2003) and ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" (2004), which led to an acting part as herself in his ""Death Proof"" segment of ""Grindhouse"" (2007). From there, she performed as a stunt double while mixing in occasional roles in films like ""Whip It"" (2009), ""Gamer"" (2009) and Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" (2012), as well as TV shows like ""Alias"" (ABC, 2001-06) and ""Lost"" (ABC, 2004-2010).

But it was his turn as the sociopathic Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's seminal ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) that propelled the then-unknown supporting actor into a star, thanks to a truly disturbing scene, forever inscribed in cinema infamy, where his character enjoys the torture and mutilation of a police officer. Able to thrive in mainstream Hollywood movies and low-brow straight-to-DVD fare, Madsen easily fluctuated from popular films like ""Thelma & Louise"" (1991) and ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) to low-budget thrillers and horror movies that barely saw the light of day. He had prominent supporting roles in David Lynch's noirish ""Mulholland Falls"" (1998), sci-fi horror hit ""Species"" (1998) and a small, but pivotal role in the James Bond movie ""Die Another Day"" (2002), as well as reuniting with Tarantino for ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" (2003), ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" (2004) and the violent western ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015).

Prior to that, he was a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival with his breakout heist-gone-wrong thriller ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). But it was ""Pulp Fiction"" that caught the attention of Hollywood, with the entertainment press selecting him - for better or worse - as the symbol of a new generation of hot, young directors. Tarantino followed up with the critically hailed ""Jackie Brown"" (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, and the epic martial arts flicks ""Kill Bill vol. 1"" (2003) and ""Kill Bill vol. 2"" (2004). After helming the ""Death Proof"" featurette in ""Grind House"" (2007), his gory collaboration with friend Robert Rodriguez, Tarantino returned to his Oscar-caliber ways with World War II fantasia ""Inglorious Basterds"" (2009), revenge epic ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ultraviolent western ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015). Regardless of what his harshest critics might have said, Tarantino remained a true auteur able to make his own films in an otherwise restrictive Hollywood system."

His television work led Stone to hire him to shoot ""Salvador"" (1986) and ""Platoon"" (1986), both of which required a cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© style that only a documentary cinematographer could offer. From there, he worked almost exclusively for Stone, filming ""Wall Street"" (1987), ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989) and ""The Doors"" (1991), while occasionally branching out to shoot films like John Sayles' ""Eight Men Out"" (1988) and ""City of Hope"" (1991). But it was his stunning work using a multitude of stock and cameras to create a documentary feel for ""JFK"" (1991), which earned the cinematographer his first Academy Award. While he sharpened the hyperkinetic style of ""JFK"" in ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994), ""Nixon"" (1995) and ""U-Turn"" (1997), Richardson was in-demand by other top Hollywood directors like Tarantino and Martin Scorsese, both of whom tapped the director of photography for films like ""Bringing Out the Dead"" (1999), ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" (2003) and ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" (2004). Richardson earned Oscars two and three for his work with Scorsese on ""The Aviator"" (2004) and ""Hugo"" (2011). As he continued to earn acclaim for projects like Tarantino's ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"" (2019), there was no doubt that Richardson was one of the finest cinematographers working in Hollywood."

Born in Berkeley, CA on August 15, 1972, Affleck's mother, Christopher Anne ""Chris"" Boldt, was a Harvard-educated elementary school teacher, while his father, Timothy Byers Affleck, was an aspiring playwright who held down a number of odd jobs over the years, including carpenter, auto mechanic, bookie, electrician, bartender, and most importantly, janitor at Harvard. When Affleck was three, his family moved from the West Coast back to Cambridge, MA, where younger brother and future co-star Casey was born. His childhood was far from happy: Affleck's father was a chronic alcoholic, and when his parents finally divorced in 1984, he recalled feeling a sense of ""relief"" that his father was out of the house (Timothy Affleck would eventually become homeless for two years due to his addiction, before entering rehab in Indio, CA, spending a full twelve years at the facility working as an addiction counselor). Around this time, 12-year-old Affleck began getting serious about pursuing a career in acting. He had already made an uncredited appearance in the indie drama ""The Dark End of the Street"" (1981) three years prior, but he soon landed his first big role in the PBS educational film ""The Voyage of the Mimi"" (PBS, 1984), thanks to his mother's friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director (though she secretly thought that acting was an insecure and ""frivolous"" profession, and hoped that her son would reconsider and become a teacher instead). Before long, Affleck was traveling across the country for auditions, often alongside Matt Damon, a friend from elementary school who proved to be just as ambitious and driven as Affleck was. The two teens saved their earnings in a joint bank account, and dreamed of one day moving to Los Angeles. After following a girlfriend to school at the University of Vermont, but dropping out after a few months after a basketball injury, Affleck moved to Los Angeles at the age of 18, where he majored in Middle Eastern affairs at Occidental College for a year and a half. While at Occidental, he directed student films, and landed a few small roles here and there, including playing Patrick Duffy's son in the TV film ""Daddy"" (NBC, 1991), taking an uncredited role as a basketball player in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1992), and popping up as a prep school student in ""School Ties"" (1992). The following year, Affleck landed what would prove to be his breakout role, when he was cast in Richard Linklater's beloved high school stoner comedy ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993). Set on the last day of school in a Texas high school in 1976, Affleck played O'Bannon, an obnoxious, borderline psychotic jock who purposely flunks his senior year so that he can participate in the school's annual freshman hazing tradition. Though ""Dazed and Confused"" was a flop upon its initial release, it has since grown into a cult classic. Affleck's first leading role was an aimless sad sack art student in the indie drama ""Glory Daze"" (1995); that same year he collaborated with the first time with writer/director Kevin Smith, playing a violent yuppie creep who manages a menswear outlet in Smith's sophomore film, ""Mallrats"" (1995). Though he had enjoyed some success up to that point, 1997 would prove to be the year that put Affleck on the map: he received rave reviews for his performance as a Korean War vet in ""Going All the Way"" (1997), and reunited with Smith for the acclaimed romantic comedy ""Chasing Amy"" (1997), in which he played a cartoonist who is madly in love with a woman who identifies as a lesbian. However, it was the success of Affleck's third film that year, ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997), that changed everything. What began as a 40-page assignment written by Damon for a playwriting class at Harvard, the pair decided to expand into a feature-length screenplay after becoming roommates in Los Angeles in 1992. Affleck and Damon sold the screenplay to Castle Rock Entertainment in 1994, but after a lengthy battle with the studio over finding a proper director, the rights were sold to Miramax, who hired indie auteur Gus Van Sant to direct. Affleck and Damon spent the next two years in Boston. Upon its release in the fall of 1997, ""Good Will Hunting"" was an instant sensation. Damon starred as Will Hunting, a janitor from South Boston working at Harvard who is secretly a genius-level prodigy (or, as Casey Affleck's character Morgan puts it at one point, ""wicked smaaaht."") After a brush with the law, he accepts a plea deal which involves training under a strict, self-serious mathematics professor (Stellen Skarsgaard), and receiving counseling from a therapist with a broken heart and a similar blue collar background (Robin Williams), who helps Will to cope with his abusive childhood and pursue a relationship with Harvard med student Skylar (Minnie Driver). Affleck played the integral supporting role of Chucky, Will's best friend who eventually provides him the tough love he needs to pursue a better life for himself. Beautifully observed, endlessly quotable, heartbreaking, funny, and perfectly scored to the music of Philip Glass and the songs of Elliott Smith, ""Good Will Hunting"" received rave reviews from critics, and eventually pulled in over $100 million at the box office. Come Oscar season, the film was nominated for nine awards, including Best Picture, and walked away with two: Best Supporting Actor for Robin Williams, and for Best Original Screenplay, 25-year-old Ben Affleck and 27-year-old Matt Damon. To this day, Affleck is the youngest person to ever win in that category. Practically overnight, Damon became a serious prestige actor, while Affleck went down the road of leading man. The following year, he starred in ""Armageddon"" (1998), director Michael Bay's sci-fi action spectacle about a group of oil drillers trained by NASA to blow up a meteor that could wipe out all life on Earth. Critics scoffed, but ""Armageddon"" was the highest grossing film of the year. Affleck rounded out 1998 by appearing alongside then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow in that year's Best Picture Oscar winner, the period romance ""Shakespeare in Love"" (1998). Next up was a detour into romantic comedy alongside Sandra Bullock in ""Forces of Nature"" (1999), and an onscreen reunion with Damon, for Kevin Smith's highly controversial, satirical look at Catholicism, ""Dogma"" (1999), in which the Affleck and Damon played a pair of fallen angels on a mission to destroy Earth and gain re-entry into the kingdom of Heaven. Meanwhile, Affleck was beginning to become interested in directing, and used the opportunity of appearing in the middling heist thriller ""Reindeer Games"" (2000) to shadow its vastly overqualified director, John Frankenheimer, on what turned out to be his final film before passing away in 2002. He also took a small turn as a corporate shark in ""Boiler Room"" (2000), and reunited with Paltrow for the romantic drama ""Bounce"" (2000), which was released right around the time the couple split up. Affleck then reunited with Michael Bay for the historical epic ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001), which found our leading man in a love triangle with a nurse (Kate Beckinsale) and his childhood best friend (Josh Hartnet). While the film's action scenes were predictably impressive, Bay proved to be utterly non-equipped to handle a splashy three-hour doomed romance, and Affleck's unfortunate Southern accent didn't help matters. The film made money, but critics scoffed. After a very meta cameo (playing both himself and his ""Chasing Amy"" character) in Kevin Smith's ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" (2001), and an unsuccessful attempt at becoming the next Jack Ryan in ""The Sum of All Fears"" (2002), Affleck earned rave reviews for his performance as a morally compromised businessman pushed to the edge in the thriller ""Changing Lanes"" (2002). It would turn out to be the last accolades he would receive for awhile. In 2003, Affleck began dating Jennifer Lopez. While he had always been a tabloid fixture, the paparazzi's interest in ""Bennifer,"" as they became known, pushed his public exposure to a point of over-saturation, to the point that GQ magazine named him the ""world's most over-exposed actor."" What didn't help matters was a series of high profile misfires and bombs: the ludicrous superhero flick ""Daredevil"" (2003), John Woo's futuristic thriller ""Paycheck"" (2003), and the dreaded ""Gigli"" (2003), one of the most notorious flops in recent memory, in which Affleck co-starred with Lopez, who by then was his fiancÃ©. Affleck's bad luck continued into 2004, which found him appearing in Kevin Smith's ill-advised attempt at serious filmmaking, ""Jersey Girl"" (2004), and the horrendous family ""comedy,"" ""Surviving Christmas"" (2004). To make matters worse, Affleck and Lopez called off their wedding the night before the ceremony was to take place, leading to much shaddenfreude in the press. A few months later, their relationship ended for good, and Affleck decided to take a much-needed break from acting. During this self-imposed hiatus, Affleck met and married actress Jennifer Garner, received rave reviews for his small role as ""Superman"" actor George Reeves in the neo-noir ""Hollywoodland"" (2006), and decided to take a dive into directing. His debut behind the camera was ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007), a police procedural set in working class Boston, and starring his younger brother, Casey Affleck, as a private eye who uncovers a conspiracy surrounding the disappearance of a young girl. While it didn't light up the box office, the film was warmly received by critics, who noted Affleck's genuine talent as a director. While he continued to appear in small roles over the next few years, including turns in ""He's Just Not That Into You"" (2009), ""State of Play"" (2009), ""Extract"" (2009), and ""The Company Men"" (2010), Affleck was clearly focused on his directorial career. His sophomore effort, ""The Town"" (2010), was a kinetic heist film set in South Boston, and starred Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Blake Lively, and Rebecca Hall. Critics praised it, and it was a surprise box office hit. For his third film, ""Argo"" (2012), Affleck starred as a CIA agent who devises a plan to rescue six stranded U.S. diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by pretending to be location scouting for a big budget sci-fi epic. ""Argo"" was a major hit with both critics and audiences, and despite the surprise of Affleck being snubbed for a Best Director nomination at that year's Oscars, ""Argo"" became the first film since the 1930s to win Best Picture without said nomination. Affleck then starred in Terrence Malick's little-seen ""To the Wonder"" (2012) and the flop thriller ""Runner Runner"" (2013) before taking on one of his most acclaimed leading roles, as a husband suspected of murdering his missing wife in David Fincher's adaptation of the popular novel ""Gone Girl"" (2014). The film was a box office hit, and critics noted Fincher's smart decision to cast Affleck as a character who is dealing with intense media scrutiny into his private life. Affleck's next move surprised everyone: he was cast as none other than Batman for Zach Snyder's superhero epic ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016). While many initially questioned whether Affleck was right for the role, when the film was released, critics had many complaints, but the uniform opinion was that Affleck's take on both the caped crusader and his alter ego, Bruce Wayne, was one of the film's rare high points. Affleck would reprise the role for a cameo in ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), and as the lead of ""Justice League"" (2017), and there were plans for a stand-alone Batman film, which Affleck would also direct. However, the actor fell on some hard times. Despite receiving treatment for alcohol addiction in the past, Affleck fell off the wagon hard following the failure of his fourth directorial effort, the period gangster piece ""Live by Night"" (2016). 2017 saw Affleck take a break from the business, and focus instead on getting sober. During this time, the Batman project fell apart, and he and Garner separated after more than a decade of marriage, allegedly due to Affleck having an affair with their nanny. Their divorce was finalized in 2018, and Affleck sadly spent the next few years in a very public fight for sobriety, relapsing a number of times. Despite his woes, Affleck continued to work, in films including Gavin O'Connor's sports drama ""The Way Back"" (2020), and Dee Rees's political thriller ""The Last Thing He Wanted"" (2020)."

A recurring turn as an eccentric dentist on ""Seinfeld"" (NBC, 1989-1998) and a meddling neighbor on ""The King of Queens"" (CBS, 1998-2007) signaled that he possessed formidable comic skills, which received a superb showcase in his Emmy-nominated performance as Hal, the manic head of the family in ""Malcolm in the Middle"" (Fox, 2000-06). Following that program's conclusion, Cranstonfound the role of a lifetime with a spellbinding performance as a terminally ill high school teacher who builds a meth lab to support his family in the critically-acclaimed drama ""Breaking Bad"" (AMC, 2008-2013). The role was a perfect opportunity for the actor to display fierce dramatic chops only previously hinted at in episodes of popular shows like ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" (CBS, 1993-2001), ""Touched By an Angel"" (CBS, 1994-2003) and ""Chicago Hope"" (CBS, 1994-2000).

With his career officially started, he made a huge impression with an Oscar-nominated performance in Norman Jewison's raucous Cold War comedy, ""The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming"" (1966), a film that put Arkin on the map for good. He made several more comedies over the next few years, and received high praise for his performance in ""The In-Laws"" (1979). Following a notable turn in ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), he delivered a standout performance as a meek salesman in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" (1992).  Arkin went on to a greater diversity of roles with ""Jerky Boys: The Movie"" (1995), ""Grosse Point Blank"" (1997), ""Four Days in September"" (1997), ""The Slums of Beverly Hills"" (1998) and ""The Pentagon Papers"" (FX, 2003). He received deserved accolades for his hilarious, but touching performance as a drug-addled, foul-mouthed septuagenarian in the surprise hit ""Little Miss Sunshine"" (2007), a role that finally earned him a long-awaited Academy Award.

For eight years, he was a crucial part of the top-rated series ""Roseanne"" (ABC, 1988-1997; 2018), playing the title character's forthright husband and comic foil before taking over as the series lead of ""The Conners"" (ABC 2018- ) after Roseanne Barr was fired from her series following controversial remarks on social media. And while he enjoyed mainstream feature film success with the box office hits ""The Flintstones"" (1994), ""Monsters, Inc."" (2001) and ""Evan Almighty"" (2007), he maintained an art house fan base as a perennial favorite in Coen Brothers movies like ""Raising Arizona"" (1987), ""Barton Fink"" (1991), ""The Big Lebowski"" (1997) and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000). Adept at any medium, Goodman thrived on the stage in productions of ""Waiting for Godot"" (2009) while returning to the small screen for the acclaimed drama ""Treme"" (HBO, 2010-13). His widely diverse roles throughout the years allowed the actor to display charm and menace - sometimes within the same role - making Goodman both an assured leading man and dependable character performer with broad audience appeal, wide range and a great deal of respect among peers."

Garber came to prominence on stage in the early 1970s after a short-lived stint in a Canadian pop group with winning performances in ""Godspell"" (1973) and ""Ghosts"" (1973). But it was his Tony Award-nominated performance in ""Deathtrap"" (1978) that earned the young actor considerable attention. From there, Garber began to make strides in features and on television, delivering solid turns in Alex Haley's ""Queen"" (CBS, 1993) and in the feature hits ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (1993) and ""Titanic (1997). Though a recognizable face to most audiences, Garber was unable to make a name for himself until he starred on ""Alias,"" which earned him a large fan base for his cold and calculating portrayal of the protective father of a CIA double agent (Jennifer Garner). The role earned him three consecutive Emmy nominations and enough clout to star in his own series, ""Justice"" (Fox, 2006), an intriguing, but unfortunately short-lived courtroom drama. But by the time he delivered a solid performance opposite Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn in the moving drama, ""Milk"" (2008), Garber had earned a reputation as one of Hollywood's most dependable and enduring supporting actors."

Supporting roles in ""Clean and Sober"" (1988) and ""Memphis Belle"" (1990) offered more adult material and paved the way for Donovan's first starring role in the romantic-comedy ""Love Potion No. 9"" (1992), co-starring Sandra Bullock. Behind the scenes, Bullock became one of several A-list actresses Donovan would become romantically involved with, followed by the likes of Jennifer Aniston and Lauren Graham. He starred alongside Jon Cryer in the short-lived sitcom ""Partners"" (Fox, 1995-96) then voiced the Greek demigod ""Hercules"" (1997) for the Disney animated feature.

In 2005, he made his feature film debut in the sci-fi thriller ""Headspace"" (2005), but Denham's love of the stage didn't wane.

Even more prominent movie roles followed, most notably in Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" (2010) and the critically acclaimed ""Argo"" (2012). In 2014, Denham decided to step behind the camera, writing and directing the horror film ""Preservation"" (2014). The film's eerie, ""less is more"" approach was inspired both by Denham's love of minimalist greats like Hitchcock, and his own squeamishness about seeing blood. In the end, the movie was applauded by critics. Denham then joined the cast of the period series ""Manhattan"" (WGN, 2014-), about the United States' infamous Manhattan Project."

Born in Buffalo, New York and raised in both suburban Illinois and rural Georgia, Chandler loved playing football as a kid. When his family left Lake Forest, Illinois when he was 11, and moved to a farm in Loganville, Georgia. It was while living in Georgia that Chandler started playing organized football. He went on to play for his high school team at George Walton Academy in Monroe, Georgia for two seasons. Despite that team winning the state championship in 1979, Chandler abruptly quit during his sophomore year to pursue his growing interest in the theater. Chandler participated in his high school theater program, and when it was time to enter college, he enrolled in the drama program at the University of Georgia. Chandler got a rush out of appearing on stage and quickly devoted himself to learning everything he needed to know about acting. Then, during his senior year, with only 7 credits short of earning his bachelor's degree in drama, Chandler dropped out to accept a TV contract with ABC. As part of his contract, which focused on grooming new talent for the network, Chandler began appearing in small parts in made-for-TV movies like ""Unconquered"" (1989) and ""Home Fires Burning"" (1989). His first big break came in 1990 when he joined the cast of the Vietnam War-themed drama series ""Tour of Duty"" (CBS, 1987-1990). Chandler appeared on 8 episodes of the series during its final season in 1990. From there he went on to nab roles in films like ""The Color of Evening"" (1990) and ""Pure Country"" (1992), and was also a cast member on the ABC's period drama ""Homefront"" (ABC, 1991-93). From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s Chandler appeared almost exclusively on TV. During this period he was a castmember on ""Early Edition"" (CBS, 1996-2000), ""What About Joan?"" (ABC, 2001), and ""The Lyon's Den"" (NBC, 2003). In 2006 Chandler was nominated for an Emmy for his guest starring role on ABC's medical drama ""Grey's Anatomy"" (ABC, 2005- ). 2006 was also the year that Chandler got the break of a lifetime when he joined the cast of ""Friday Night Lights"" as Coach Eric Taylor. The series, which was based on a 2004 film of the same name, received overwhelmingly positive praise throughout its 5 season run, with some critics going on to call it one of the greatest television shows of all time. For his work on the series, Chandler took home his first Emmy Award. After ""Friday Night Lights"" ended in 2011, Chandler went on to appear in supporting roles in a number of Oscar-nominated films, most notably ""Argo"" (2012), ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013), ""Carol"" (2015), and ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016). In 2015 Chandler returned to TV with a starring turn on the Netflix thriller ""Bloodline"" (Netflix, 2015-17), which earned him two more Emmy nominations. In 2019, with over 30 years of acting experience under his belt, Chandler appeared on the Hulu mini-series ""Catch-22"" (Hulu, 2019), which was based on the acclaimed novel of the same name. 2019 was also the year Chandler played the role of Dr. Mark Russell in the blockbuster monster film ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters.""

After studying privately with a number of acting coaches in New York City, Messina began appearing in off-Broadway shows, before following in the footsteps of many Manhattan thespians before him and appearing on an episode of ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010). In 1998 Messina broke into film, appearing in the poker drama ""Rounders"" (1998), the military thriller ""The Siege"" (1998) and the romantic comedy ""You've Got Mail"" (1998). Following a few more years of cameo appearances, he landed his first series regular gig, playing Ted Fairwell on the final season of ""Six Feet Under"" (HBO, 2001-2005). Messina continued to work regularly in independent film as well, co-starring in the romantic comedy ""Ira & Abby"" (2006), the domestic drama ""Towelhead"" (2007) which was written and directed by ""Six Feet Under"" creator Alan Ball, Woody Allen's erotic dramedy ""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" (2008), and Noah Baumbach's midlife crisis drama ""Greenberg"" (2010), alongside more mainstream fare like the romantic comedy ""Made of Honor"" (2008), the box office hit ""Julie & Julia"" (2009), and the horror chiller ""Devil"" (2010). In the 2010s, Messina became a much more familiar face on television, thanks to starring roles on series like ""Damages"" (FX/Audience Network, 2007-2012), ""The Newsroom"" (HBO, 2012-14), ""The Mindy Project"" (FOX/Hulu, 2012-17) and ""Sharp Objects"" (HBO, 2018). He also became a favorite of director Ben Affleck, appearing in his films ""Argo"" (2012), and ""Live By Night"" (2016). Messina could next be seen in the DC superhero movie ""Birds of Prey"" (2020) and on the third season of ""The Sinner"" (USA Network, 2017-)."

Already an accomplished stage star, Ivanek appeared in several film and TV projects, often as conniving and evil men who wore three-piece suits. His performance as a smooth-talking Southern lawyer in ""Damages"" (FX, 2007-12) earned the Slovenian-born actor his first time Emmy Award nomination and win in 2008, where he went up against his co-star Ted Danson for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series."
1729,Titus Welliver,3/12/1961,"New Haven, Connecticut, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/JVF5DUT5g-nlsL7ghamjeOeBhg4=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/84186_v9_bb.jpg,"Titus Welliver was an American actor who appeared in dozens of films and TV shows over the course of his 25-plus year acting career, most notably as the star of the Amazon Studios cop drama ""Bosch"" (Amazon Studios, 2014- ). Born in New Haven, Connecticut and raised in New York and Philadelphia, Welliver was fortunate enough to have had a creative upbringing. His father was a famous landscape artist, while his mother worked as a fashion illustrator, so the Welliver house was always filled with poets, artists and various other creative types when Titus was growing up. Although Welliver initially intended on following in his father's footsteps by becoming a landscape artist, by his late teens he began focusing on a career in acting instead. With that in mind, Welliver packed his bags and moved to New York City. He enrolled in classes at New York's famed HB Acting Studio, and also studied at New York University. After years of honing his craft with non-paid work, Welliver nabbed his first paid acting role with a small part in the Charlie Sheen action drama ""Navy Seals"" (1990). The following year he landed a small role in Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" (1991), and continued nabbing film and TV roles throughout the remainder of the decade. Welliver's first big break came in 1997 when he joined the cast of Steven Bochco's short lived cop drama ""Brooklyn South"" (CBS, 1997-98). The series last for one season, but it wouldn't be the last time Welliver played a cop on TV. Over the next several years Welliver played law enforcement agents on a variety of TV dramas, including ""NYPD Blue"" (ABC, 1993-2005), ""Big Apple"" (CBS, 2001) and ""Numbers"" (CBS, 2005-2010). Then in 2004 Welliver was cast on the HBO period drama ""Deadwood"" (HBO, 2004-06). He played Silas Adams on the series, which lasted three seasons. Working on ""Deadwood"" also gave Welliver the opportunity to once again work with the legendary TV writer David Milch (the two had previously worked together on ""NYPD Blue""). After ""Deadwood"" ended its run, Welliver continued working steadily in films and on TV throughout the 2000s and 2010s. In 2014 he returned to familiar territory when he was cast as the LAPD police officer Harry Bosch on the Amazon Studios series ""Bosch,"" which entered its third season in 2017. The previous year, Welliver had the opportunity to work with director Ben Affleck for a fourth time when he was cast in the Prohibition Era crime drama ""Live By Night."" Up until that point, Welliver had previously appeared in Affleck's ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007), ""The Town"" (2010), and ""Argo"" (2012)."

Possessing a long face, clear eyes and handsome if slightly uneven features, he has most typically played intense, aggressive character roles. Szarabajka made his feature debut in ""Simon"" (1980) but made more of an impression alongside Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon in Costa-Gavras' potent political drama, ""Missing"" (1982). Several years later, he made his first filmic impression as Spacek's sympathetic friend in the government corruption expose, ""Marie: A True Story"" (1985) and subsequently appeared prominently in the enjoyable but minor action comedy ""The Misfit Brigade"" (1986) and as part of the gung-ho contingent of Alex Cox's misfire biopic ""Walker"" (1987). Since the late 80s, he has been less active on the big screen. He played a lobster fisherman in ""Andre"" (1994), and enjoyed a meatier role as Kevin Costner's nasty fellow prison escapee in ""A Perfect World"" (1993)."
1731,Bob Gunton,11/15/1945,"Santa Monica, California, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/lfxb4JVHa-yzrZpiVJM8pXOdPMg=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/71567_v9_bb.jpg,"Like all good character actors, Bob Gunton is probably known more by his face than his name - his craggy, often impassive visage has essayed a score of tough, taciturn, often morally questionable men, the best known of which was the cold-hearted warden in ""The Shawshank Redemption."" But the California native has given life to a wide variety of roles during his four decades as an actor, including several award-winning musical performances on Broadway and in several comedies, including ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls"" on the big screen and the cult series ""Greg the Bunny"" (2002) on the small screen. Born Robert Gunton, Jr. in Santa Monica, CA on Nov. 15, 1945, he attended St. Peter's College in Maryland and the University of California at Irvine, graduating in 1968. Soon after, the young man served in the Army from 1969 to 1971, where he received the Viet Service Medal and Bronze Star for Valor. Upon his return to civilian life, Gunton gravitated towards theater work; his earliest credit is the off-Broadway production ""Who Am I?"" in 1971. Over the next decade, he amassed an impressive list of stage credits in dramas, comedies, and musicals, including ""King of Hearts,"" ""Evita"" (opposite Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin), ""Big River,"" ""How I Got That Story,"" and the 1989 revival of ""Sweeney Todd."" For his work, Gunton received a Drama Desk Award in 1980 for ""Evita"" and an Obie that same year for ""How I Got That Story,"" as well as Tony nominations for ""Evita"" and ""Sweeney Todd."" Gunton began working in front of cameras in the early 1980s, starting with a supporting role in Alan J. Pakula's ""Rollover"" (1981). He would divide his time between film and television for the next decade, with occasional inroads onto a TV series, including a stint on the little-seen sketch improv show ""Comedy Zone"" (CBS, 1983-84) which also featured Joe Mantegna and Mark Linn-Baker. Gunton's screen persona was quickly established during this period; he was drawn to and effectively portrayed strong-willed men of power - like Jacqueline Bouvier's stepfather Hugh Auchincloss in ""A Woman Called Jackie"" (NBC, 1991), Governor George Wallace in ""Unconquered"" (CBS, 1989) - or calculating heels, like his villainous company spy in John Sayles' ""Matewan"" (1987). He also covered his share of military men (""Glory"" (1989) and ""Mission of the Shark"" (CBS, 1991)) and government types (""The Public Eye"" (1992)), before catching the attention of Oliver Stone, who cast him in smaller roles in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989) and ""JFK"" (1991). Higher profile projects seemed to follow, including turns in Stone's miniseries ""Wild Palms"" (ABC, 1993), ""Patriot Games"" (1992), the excellent Charles Starkweather biopic ""Murder in the Heartland"" (ABC, 1993), and the TV miniseries ""Sinatra"" (CBS, 1992) in which he played bandleader Tommy Dorsey. In 1994, Gunton caught audiences' attention as Warden Norton in Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" an adaptation of a Stephen King novella that developed a sizable following in the decade after its release. Gunton's roles grew somewhat meatier after ""Shawshank,"" though his characters remained essentially the same - he played Franklin D. Roosevelt in the TV movie ""Kingfish: A Story of Huey P. Long"" (TNT, 1995), Richard Nixon in the comic revisionist TV movie ""Elvis Meets Nixon"" (Showtime, 1997) and prosecuting attorney Finley Largent in Clint Eastwood's ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" (1997). Gunton also appeared in the feature films ""The Perfect Storm"" (1999), John Woo's ""Broken Arrow"" (1996), and perhaps his most hissable antagonist in the Robin Williams melodrama, ""Patch Adams"" (1998). Gunton also logged considerable hours on episodic television and made-for-TV features, including recurring roles on ""Nip/Tuck"" (FX 2003-2010) and ""Desperate Housewives"" (ABC 2004-2012), as well as a turn as Woodrow Wilson in the HBO production ""Iron-Jawed Angels"" (2004). He also appeared in high profile films including ""I Heart Huckabees"" (2004), Matthew McConaughey's comeback vehicle ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" (2011), Best Picture Oscar winner ""Argo"" (2012), and miner rescue drama ""The 33"" (2015). He also began a recurring role on the comic book series ""Daredevil"" (Netflix 2015- ) as supervillain Leland Owlsley."

Born in Tehran, Abtahi had a bit of a nomadic childhood. He lived in Iran until the age of 5, before moving with his family to Paris. He would stay in the French capital until the age of 10, before moving once again, although this time to the United States. Abtahi and his family eventually settled in Irvine, California, where Abtahi would stay for the remainder of his childhood. He lived a relatively normal life in California, and soon entered California State University, Fullerton to study advertising. While attending the school, however, Abtahi became intrigued with the idea of becoming a professional actor. With that in mind, he added theater as his second major, where he fell in love with the craft. After graduating in 2002, Abtahi decided to embark on an acting career. He auditioned for film and TV roles, and landed his first part in 2005 on the legal drama ""JAG"" (NBC/CBS, 1995-2005). Abtahi's TV career quickly took off, and in just a year's time he had nabbed a recurring part on the Showtime series ""Sleeper Cell"" (2005-06). After his yearlong run on ""Sleeper Cell"" ended, Abtahi continued appearing on television shows, as well as movies, throughout the 2000s. His more notable TV roles during this time included recurring parts on ""My Own Worst Enemy"" (NBC, 2008) and ""24"" (Fox, 2001-2010). Then in 2012 Abtahi appeared in the Oscar-winning historical drama ""Argo,"" thus further elevating his already growing acting profile. He continued appearing primarily on television shows throughout the 2010s, most notably with recurring roles on ""Homeland"" and ""Better Call Saul,"" while also voicing roles for video games such as ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare"" (2016). In 2017 Abtahi returned to TV once again with a recurring role on ""American Gods."" The series premiered on the Starz network in early 2017."

Born Dec. 31, 1976, Terrio's path to feature films began as a literature student at Harvard University. There, he encountered acclaimed director James Ivory, whom he contacted following a speech at the school. To Terrio's surprise, Ivory sent him a letter in return, which marked the beginning of their professional relationship. After transferring to the University of Southern California to study film production, Terrio's background in literature earned him an assistant position to Ivory on ""The Golden Bowl"" (2000). Subsequent work for the director's famed film company, Merchant Ivory Productions, included shooting a behind-the-scenes documentary for ""Le Divorce"" (2003) before Ivory's partner, producer Ismail Merchant, offered him a script by Amy Fox called ""Heights"" that had remained in development for several years. Terrio made his directorial debut with the 2005 release, which featured an all-star cast led by Elizabeth Banks, Glenn Close, James Marsden and Isabella Rossellini. Despite a premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, Terrio received no subsequent directing offers, and turned to writing scripts. In 2010, he returned briefly to the director's chair for an episode of ""Damages"" (FX/Audience Network, 2007-2012). Though highly regarded by industry insiders, Terrio's screenplays went unproduced until 2011, when producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov hired him to pen a script based on the Canadian Caper, a famed joint effort between the CIA and Canadian government to rescue American diplomats trapped in Iran during the 1979 revolution by means of an elaborate ruse to portray them as Hollywood film scouts researching Middle Eastern locations for a science fiction movie. Directed by and co-starring Ben Affleck, the resulting picture, ""Argo"" (2011), was a box office hit as well as a critical success which earned Terrio an Oscar for Best (Adapted) Screenplay. He was soon attached to several high-profile feature projects, including a reunion with Clooney and Heslov on a crime thriller for director Paul Greengrass, an English-language remake of the French film ""Tell No One"" (2006), and ""A Murder Foretold,"" a drama based on a New Yorker article about a Guatemalen businessman's search for his wife's killers.

Having met Clooney while doing an episode of ""The Facts of Life""(NBC, 1979-1988), Heslov remained close friends with the rising star, as he, himself, continued taking small parts in film and on television like ""L.A. Law"" (NBC, 1986-1994), ""True Lies"" (1994) and ""Dante's Peak"" (1997). After making his directorial bow with the little-seen comedy, ""Par 6"" (2002), Heslov joined forces with Clooney and director Steven Soderbergh to become president of the television arm of their production company, Section Eight. While there, he oversaw two critically-acclaimed, but ultimately short-lived series, ""K Street"" (HBO, 2003) and ""Unscripted"" (HBO, 2004), while serving as one of the producers on the multi-Oscar-nominated drama, ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" (2004). But when Section Eight closed its doors, Heslov and Clooney partnered on their new production company, Smoke House, which provided him the opportunity to direct his first major feature, ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" (2009), and co-writing the Oscar-nominated drama ""The Ides of March"" (2011), while maintaining both a strong friendship and creative partnership with Clooney."

Not satisfied with being confined to strictly comedy, Foxx surprised many when he began displaying considerable talents both as a dramatic actor and as a classically trained musician.

Originally hailing from Ireland, Norton burst onto the UK TV scene in 1992 as a guest performer and occasional actor on various projects. His impish personality and seemingly inexhaustible energy led to a steady slew of talk shows, which allowed him to exercise his love for innuendo-laden comments and pop culture, which was alternately tweaked and paid tribute by the comedian. He also became a much-loved host for a vast array of variety series, including ""How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?"" (BBC One 2006), and the venerable Eurovision Song Contest. Norton also shrewdly served as producer for most of his TV efforts, which helped to make his production company, So Television, a hugely successful entity by the time of its sale to ITV in 2012 for more than Â£15 million. Though widespread success in America largely eluded Graham Norton, his status as one of Europe's most popular TV personalities remained untouched."

His success on the show opened American doors, including landing a role on the never-aired American remake, and he was tapped to star alongside Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Jonah Hill in the sci-fi comedy ""The Watch"" (2012).

The intense and muscular Studi first gained attention playing the ""toughest"" of the Pawnees in Kevin Costner's ambitious and well-meaning revisionist work ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990). He also lent his powerful presence to Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" (1991), as the silent Indian in the desert, before coming into his own as a film and TV character player. The Oklahoma-born performer's native language is Cherokee, which he spoke until he started primary school at age five. Returning from serving in the Vietnam War, Studi became seriously involved with Native American politics. He joined the American Indian Movement and participated in their 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Studi subsequently attended college and helped start a Cherokee newspaper. He also began teaching the Cherokee language professionally before shifting to running his own horse ranch. The late 70s found Studi divorced and bereft of his ranch. Thinking it would be a good way to meet women, he decided to start taking acting lessons.  Studi gained substantial stage experience in many productions with the American Indian Theatre Company and in a touring one-man show, ""Coyote Chews His Own Tale."" He consolidated his standing in films with a searing performance as the fiercely angry Magua in Michael Mann's stirring adaptation of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992). Studi finally entered the limelight via his gritty yet noble interpretation of the title role of Walter Hill's classically elegant $35 million biopic ""Geronimo: An American Legend"" (1993). The commercial failure of that project sent him back to more fully clothed character roles in the forgettable Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle ""Street Fighter"" (1994) and the high profile crime film ""Heat"" (1995). The latter project reunited him with ""Last of the Mohicans"" writer-director Mann and cast him as a L.A. cop aiding Al Pacino in his pursuit of professional thief Robert De Niro and his gang. Studi's distinctive bass voice can often be heard on TV documentaries about the Native American experience. He has also appeared in several historical TV-movies, series and miniseries. Wes Studi received an Honorary oscar at the 2nd Annual Academy Awards in 2020."

He was born on May 17, 1965 in New Castle, Pennsylvania, he learned piano as a child and later played sax and tuba in school. He began playing in bands while still in high school and quit college to concentrate on music, relocating to Cleveland in the process. He played with a number of bands and eventually got a job at a recording studio, where he had the opportunity to work on demos for what would become the first Nine Inch Nails songs. He signed to TVT Records and released the first NIN album, Pretty Hate Machine, in 1989, charting low but earning Gold status. Likely aided by Reznor's appearances on the first Lollapalooza tour in 1991, the next album, 1994's The Downward Spiral, became a blockbuster. Eventually achieving quadruple Platinum status and spawning the hit ""Closer,"" it broke Nine Inch Nails through to the mainstream and made Reznor an alternative rock icon. That same year, Reznor made his first forays into Hollywood, working on the music for the hit film ""Natural Born Killers."" 1999's The Fragile proved to be similarly successful, reaffirming Reznor's continuing rock-star status. Thereafter, he would switch back and forth between film projects and Nine Inch Nails. Though the next couple of Nine Inch Nails albums were successful, Reznor went indie with 2008's Ghosts I-IV, starting his own label, The Null Corporation. 2009 marked the debut EP of How To Destroy Angels, the group Reznor formed with his vocalist wife Mariqueen Maandig, Atticus Ross, and Rob Sheridan. They released an album, Welcome Oblivion, in 2013. Nine Inch Nails returned to the major label world that same year with Hesitation Marks. The follow-up, Bad Witch, arrived five years later."

As if a storied screen career and rich history on the stage weren't enough, Turman also earned acclaim for his talents as a director, both theatrically and in the television industry. Revered likewise for his roles on the soap opera ""Peyton Place"" (ABC 1964-69), the sitcom ""A Different World"" (NBC 1987-1993), and the drama series ""The Wire"" (HBO 2002-08), Turman's is a fame that not only transcends time, but genre. Glynn Russell Turman was born on January 31, 1947 in New York City, New York. He began his acting career in 1959 with a role in the original Broadway production of A Raisin in the Sun. He followed this turn with an appearance in a televised production of Black Monday in 1961, as part of the syndicated anthology series ""Play of the Week"" (NTA Film Network 1959-1961). Turman graduated from the High School of Performing Arts, located in Manhattan, and set anew to a life of stage and screen acting. He kicked off his television career with a substantial recurring role on the drama series ""Peyton Place"" (ABC 1964-69), on which he starred for 37 episodes as the character Lew Miles. Turman made his film debut with a minor part in the racially themed romantic drama ""Honky"" (1971), which he followed up with appearances on TV shows like ""The Doris Day Show"" (CBS 1968-1973) and ""Hawaii Five-O"" (CBS 1968-1980), as well as with roles in movies including ""Five on the Black Hand Side"" (1973), ""Thomasine & Bushrod"" (1974), ""The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat"" (1974), and ""Together Brothers"" (1974). Turman's first headlining role came with the coming-of-age dramedy ""Cooley High"" (1975), in which he played a high school student nicknamed Preach. Throughout the 1970s, Turman continued to explore stage productions, both as an actor and a director. He rounded out the decade with a role on the historical miniseries ""Centennial"" (NBC 1978-79). In 1978, Turman married musical superstar Aretha Franklin. The 1980s gave Turman a slew of one-off television roles, as well as parts in feature films including ""Penitentiary II"" (1982) and the popular horror comedy ""Gremlins"" (1984). In 1988, Turman began a four-season-long stint as Col. Brad Taylor on the family comedy series ""A Different World"" (NBC 1987-1993). In addition to his role on the series, Turman directed a number of its episodes, and went on to do the same for 1990s sitcoms including ""The Parent Hood"" (The WB 1995-99) and ""The Wayans Bros."" (The WB 1995-99). Returning to dramatic acting, Turman then amounted roles in ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"" (1998), ""Light It Up"" (1999), and ""Men of Honor"" (2000). Turman achieved favor with a new generation thanks to a substantial role as Baltimore Mayor Clarence V. Royce on the critically revered drama series ""The Wire"" (HBO 2002-08). Alongside a subsequent recurring role on the drama program ""In Treatment"" (HBO 2008-2010), Turman accumulated work in high profile films like the musical ""Burlesque"" (2010) and the science-fiction film ""Super 8"" (2011). At the inception of the dramedy series ""House of Lies"" (Showtime 2012-), Turman took on the part of Jeremiah Kaan, disapproving father to series star Don Cheadle's character Marty."

He attended Broadway performances of ""Hello, Dolly!"" with Pearl Bailey and a revival of ""West Side Story"" which knocked him out and pointed him in the direction of his life's work. Escaping to California from Kentucky, he taught acting in addition to writing and directing for small theaters in the Los Angeles area before moving to NYC in 1979, eventually enrolling in the masters program in dramatic writing and musical theater at NYU. While at NYU, he started the play that would catch Papp's attention, ""The Colored Museum."" This stinging satire on black stereotypes opened to critical raves at the Public in 1986 although some within the black community were offended by the characters presented. After winning an OBIE for his direction of ""Spunk"" (1989-90), which he had adapted from three stories by Zora Neale Hurston, Wolfe earned his first Tony nominations for the book and direction of ""Jelly's Last Jam"" (1992), a musical about the life of jazz musician Jelly Roll Morton. He then became the first black director of a Broadway production that was not black-themed when he helmed Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama about politics, AIDS and religion ""Angels in America: Millennium Approaches,"" winning the 1993 Tony as Director of a Play. He picked up another Tony nomination the following year for staging the second part of Kushner's epic, ""Angels in America: Perestroika,"" and garnered two more Tony nods in 1996 for helming ""The Tempest,"" starring Patrick Stewart, and the Savion Glover dance musical ""Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk,"" winning for the latter. The magic ran out with his 1998 revival of ""On the Town"" when his controversial decision to replace Jerome Robbins' signature choreography came back to haunt him, and though critical response was slightly better for ""The Wild Party"" (2000), which he directed and co-scripted, it paled in comparison to his triumphs in the 90s. Wolfe became one of the Public's three resident directors in 1990 and replaced Papp's hand-picked successor JoAnne Akalaitis after her troubled 20-month tenure in 1993, becoming the only person besides Papp in the theater's history to hold the title of producer. In the first five years after taking over the theater's reins, he saw its endowments quadruple from $10 million to $40 million. Though criticized in some circles for championing his own projects more than the other works at the Public, Wolfe proved an able administrator, returning the institution to the black by 1995 after seven years of operating at a deficit. As producer, his decision to move ""The Tempest"" to Broadway for a limited run netted a modest $325,000, while moving ""Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk"" to Broadway and the unprecedented decision to promote the show's national tour as well amounted to a huge windfall for America's most influential and powerful not-for-profit theater. After directing a successful revival of ""On the Town,"" Wolfe wrote and directed ""The Wild Party"" and directed the one-woman smash ""Elaine Stritch at Liberty."" Wolfe returned to television and film infrequently but successfully, directing the TV movie ""Lackawanna Blues"" (2005), romance ""Nights in Rodanthe"" (2008), and tearjerker ""You're Not You"" (2013). (Wolfe also acted in a small role in the hit comedy ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2006).) After directing well-received revivals of ""Mother Courage and her Children"" and ""The Normal Heart,"" Wolfe wrote and directed acclaimed musical ""Shuffle Along, or the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,"" one of the biggest hits of the 2015-16 Broadway season."

After completing a theater degree at the University of Southern California, Black moved into the world of casting, but quickly began to make his mark as a film producer alongside Joe Wizan on TV movies and comedies in the very early 1990s. He had his first notable success with ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway,"" where Irish alcoholic Richard Harris and Cuban barber Robert Duvall form an unlikely bond. From there, Black landed a position as president of motion picture production at Sony's Mandalay Entertainment, where he produced standard Hollywood fare through the '90s. He hit his stride with the 2002 drama ""Antwone Fisher,"" directed by and starring Denzel Washington, which was a major success and led to work with Will Smith and Italian director Gabriele Muccino on the sweet family film ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" That team collaborated again two years later on the mortality drama ""Seven Pounds."" Meanwhile, Black, now working with heavyweight producer Steve Tisch, produced the inspirational classroom drama ""The Great Debaters,"" again with Washington behind the camera, and the prophetic sci-fi thriller ""Knowing"" with Nicolas Cage."
1781,Denzel Washington,12/28/1954,"Mount Vernon, New York, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/FFD-oW-i5gaBHbv3wwKzSifU7SY=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/16490_v9_bb.jpg,"A powerful presence in features since the mid-1980s, Oscar winner Denzel Washington plumbed the inner depths of such formidable figures as Malcolm X, Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter, drug dealer Frank Lucas and Stephen Biko, as well as a slew of heavyweight fictional characters in ""Training Day"" (2001), ""Flight"" (2012), ""Fences"" (2016) and ""Roman J. Israel, Esq."" (2017). Born Denzel Hayes Washington, Jr. in Mount Vernon, New York on December 28, 1954, he was one of two sons by a Pentecostal minister father and a mother who owned a beauty shop. Though he had appeared in a talent show while in elementary school, performing was not consideration until his college years. Sports dominated his interest while at Oakland Military Academy and later, Mainland High School in Florida. From there, he enrolled at Fordham University, but took a semester off to decide on his future plans. While working as a creative director at a camp in Connecticut, a friend suggested that he might consider acting as a career; Washington then returned to Fordham, where he earned a degree in drama and journalism, and logged a year at the American Conservatory Theater in California before returning to New York to make his way as a professional actor. Roles in Maryland summer stock preceded his television acting debut in ""Wilma"" (NBC, 1977), about Olympic sprinter Wilma Rudolph. After making his feature film debuti in the comedy ""Carbon Copy"" (1981), Washington netted a Ensemble Performance Obie as part of the cast of A Soldier's Play. His breakout role came the following year when he was cast as the determined physician Philip Chandler on ""St. Elsewhere"" (NBC, 1982-88). He then reprised his Off-Broadway role in ""A Soldier' Story"" (1984), and worked steadily in television and features before drawing universal acclaim for his performance as South African activist Stephen Biko in Richard Attenborough's ""Cry Freedom"" (1987). Washington won an Oscar nomination for his intense performance, and two years later captured the Academy Award as an African-American soldier in the Union Army in ""Glory"" (1989). Now minted as a bona fide leading man with back-to-back Oscar successes, Washington began a long and fruitful period of screen work, beginning in 1990 with ""Mo' Better Blues,"" a story set in the jazz world by writer/director Spike Lee. The pair would reunite in 1992 for ""Malcolm X,"" an epic biography of the civil rights leader that brought Washington another Oscar nomination for Best Actor. After displaying his theatrical talents as Don Pedro in Kenneth Branagh's colorblind production of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (1993), Washington starred as a lawyer defending Tom Hanks, who had lost his job due to the AIDS virus, in Jonathan Demme's critically acclaimed ""Philadelphia"" (1993). Feature assignments opposite Julia Roberts in ""The Pelican Brief"" (1996), Gene Hackman in ""Crimson Tide"" and Whitney Houston in ""The Preacher's Wife"" (1996) preceded his third collaboration with Lee on ""He Got Game"" (1998), with Washington as an incarcerated father who hoped to influence his son to sign with a major basketball college. The following year, his powerful turn as wrongly imprisoned boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter in ""The Hurricane"" (1999) made Washington the first African-American actor to win a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Drama since 1963. His streak of solid performances in memorable roles continued into the new millennium when he won his second Oscar for ""Training Day"" (2001), Antone Fuqua's gritty police drama with Washington as a hotwired corrupt Los Angeles detective. He then made his feature directorial debut with ""Antwone Fisher"" (2002), with Derek Luke as a real-life Navy seaman who fought to overcome a troubled past with the help of a military doctor (played by Washington). A modest but well-reviewed effort, it preceded a long period of minor successes for Washington, including the action-thrillers ""Out of Time"" (2003) and Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire"" (2004), Demme's ill-advised remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2004) with Washington in Frank Sinatra's role, as well a crime thriller with Lee called ""Inside Man"" (2006) and a 2009 remake of ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" More to form was Ridley Scott's ""American Gangster"" (2007), with Washington as notorious drug trafficker Frank Lucas; he also found time to direct a second feature, ""The Great Debaters"" in 2007. After the success of ""Gangster,""Washington returned to the stage for a Broadway revival of August Wilson's Fences, opposite Viola Davis, which netted him a Tony Award for Best Actor. He then returned to features, though again in minor genre efforts like the post-apocalyptic ""Book of Eli"" (2010) and ""Unstoppable""(2010) for Tony Scott. But ""Flight"" (2012), about an alcoholic airline pilot who rescued a plane from crashing, brought him an Oscar nomination, and he scored back-to-back box office hits with a pair of remakes for director Antone Fuqua: ""The Equalizer"" (2014), based on the popular CBS action series, drew substantive box office returns, while his starring role in a remake of ""The Magnificent Seven"" in 2016. Between these efforts, Washington also scored a stage success with a Broadway revival of A Raisin in the Sun, which won the 2014 Tony. He then returned to the director's chair for a film version of ""Fences"" (2016), which earned him both the Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor. The following year, Washington's performance as an unorthodox lawyer in Dan Gilroy's ""Roman J. Israel, Esq."" (2017) brought a ninth Oscar nomination and sixth for Best Actor, as well as acting nods from the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild."

Before he was done with school, he started touring with Art Blakey playing saxophone. That experience led to more work in the early 1980s with a legion of acclaimed jazz musicians including Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis, and Dizzy Gillespie. In this time, he put out his first solo album, Scenes in the City, and was a part of a variety of other projects, with his high-profile work on Sting's debut solo album The Dream of the Blue Turtles making him nearly as well-known as his elder brother Wynton Marsalis. 1986 saw Marsalis' first Grammy nomination for his third album Royal Garden Blues. In 1990, Marsalis played live with the Grateful Dead in what became a legendary improvised performance. He was the bandleader for the first three years of ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" (NBC 1992-2014) before ceding the bandleader chair to guitarist Kevin Eubanks; the same year, he won his first Grammy award for I Heard You Twice the First Time. For a few years, he headed up the band Buckshot LeFonque, which combined jazz and rock for a unique sound. However, by the late '90s, Marsalis focused more on classically inspired works, eschewing rock accents for large symphonic orchestras. He was a regular nominee at the Grammys, earning two more wins over a span of two decades. In 2010, his work on the music for the revival of the play Fences earned him a Tony nomination."

1789,Jackie Coogan,10/26/1914,"Los Angeles, California, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/jFJpsvnuBdkBON0WANX_dTYeaVU=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/28560_v9_bb.jpg,"Child star who charmed audiences in Charlie Chaplin's 1921 classic ""The Kid."" By the mid-1930s, his career had slowed considerably and in 1938 he attempted to win back his $4 million childhood earnings from his mother and stepfather. By the time the case was settled the amount had dropped to approximately $250,000, of which Coogan received only a portion. The case resulted in the Coogan Act, or Child Actors Bill, set up to protect the assets of child stars. Coogan became, in many ways, the patron saint -- of sorts -- of child actors because of the law, although the legislation only covers actors working in California and, in reality, applies to income from TV series and motion pictures and not TV commercials. After WWII, most of his work came from TV where he gained success as Uncle Fester on ""The Addams Family,"" which ran on ABC from 1964-66. Coogan began his career at 18 months, in ""Skinner's Baby"" (1917). He played the title role in a silent version of ""Oliver Twist"" in 1922.  He switched studios from First National to Metro for a contract which guaranteed him $1 over two years, although his personal allowance remained at $6.25 per week. By 1927, Coogan's popularity had begun to wane, and his bob hair was cut in a much-publicized ceremony, which was filmed for theatrical release. MGM decided to capitalize on the event by producing the film, ""Johnny Get Your Hair Cut."" But, his career was still dwindling. He made a comeback in the title role of ""Tom Sawyer"" (1930), also his first talkie, and repeated that role in ""Huckleberry Finn"" (1931), but Jackie Cooper was now the kid star of the MGM lot and in America's heart. It was in 1935 when returning from a fishing trip that the car, driven by Coogan's father, went off the road, killing all (including child actor Junior Curkin) except Coogan, who had been in the rumple seat. Coogan was off the screen until 1938, trying to make another come-back in young adult roles in ""College Swing."" By this time he had married Starlet Betty Grable, but with his earnings lost by his mother and stepfather and few film roles available, the stress over financial matters contributed to the couple divorcing in 1939. Coogan did not appear in a film from 1939 until after World War II service. His first film after the war was ""Kilroy was Here"" (1947), which also starred, perhaps ironically, Jackie Cooper, also struggling after child stardom. But feature film roles were few and far between, and by the late 40s, Coogan was mostly working on TV. He was a regular on Benny Rubin's 1949 NBC series, and a panelist on Mike Storey's ""Pantomime Quiz"" from 1950-55. He was a third banana -- aide the colonel on his sitcom debut, ""McKeever and the Colonel"" (NBC, 1962-63). He was the first choice of the executive producer to play Uncle Fester on ""The Addams Family"" for ABC in 1964, but not of the network. Maurice Gosfield played the role in the original pilot, but died soon after production and Coogan stepped into the role which would give him lasting visibility as an adult. After the series' demise, Coogan did the voice of Fester for the 1973-74 animated version of ""The Addams Family,"" and appeared often in episodic dramas. He made his TV movie debut with ""Cool Million"" (NBC, 1972). His last TV appearance was in an episode of ""Sweepstake$"" on NBC in 1979. It is said he appeared in 1400 TV shows and episodes combined. Coogan's grandson, Keith Coogan, born in 1970, appeared in ""Tin Soldiers,"" ""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"" and numerous other films in the 80s and 90s. Keith was born Keith Mitchell, but took the last name ""Coogan"" as his professional name after his grandfather's 1984 death as an homage."

Still, the younger Affleck saw himself on another path, eschewing studio-produced Frankenstein projects in favor of eclectic character parts. The promise of his early work in ""To Die For"" (1995) and ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) did eventually lead him to the blockbuster types like ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) and its star-packed sequels. While nestled comfortably into one of Hollywood's most entertaining ensembles, Affleck still found a way to comfortably transform in a variety of projects, creating a witty, quirky onscreen persona along the way. How ironic then, that it was his superstar brother who, despite potential cries of nepotism, cast Affleck in the moody, haunting thriller that was Ben's directorial debut, ""Gone, Baby, Gone"" (2007) - making critics and audiences see his little brother as a real leading man in his own right at long last. However, even an Oscar-nominated turn in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (2007) didn't cause Affeck to change his idiosyncratic career path: he next directed a quirky mockumentary, ""I'm Still Here"" (2010), co-written by longtime friend Joaquin Phoenix and starring Phoenix as a fictionalized version of himself on a bizarre farewell tour to his life as an actor. Supporting roles in hits like animated comedy ""ParaNorman"" (2012) and Christopher Nolan's science fiction fantasy ""Interstellar"" (2014) kept Affleck in the public eye until his breakthrough performance in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea"" won him the Academy award for Best Actor and made him a mainstream film star at last. However, his next project ""A Ghost Story"" (2017) made it clear that Affleck was sticking to his idiosyncratic indie roots."

Born Michelle Ingrid Williams in Kalispell, Montana on September 9, 1980, she relocated with her younger sister and three paternal half-siblings to San Diego, California when she was nine years of age. There, she became interested in acting after seeing a stage version of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and began appearing in local theater productions. In her teenaged years, Williams began traveling to Los Angeles to audition for film and television roles, and made her screen debut as a seductive teenager in a 1993 episode of ""Baywatch"" (NBC/syndicated, 1989-2001). Appearances in features like ""Lassie"" (1994) and ""Species"" (1995) preceded her breakout role on ""Dawson's Creek."" Williams played Jen Lindley, the most visibly troubled member of the series' quartet of self-analyzing teens; though a ratings hit and a launching board for Williams's appearances in teen-oriented features like ""Halloween: H20"" (1998) and ""Dick"" (1999), she longed for more substantive work, and found it between seasons in the Off-Broadway production of Tracy Letts's Killer Joe and the HBO feature ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" (2000), which cast her and Chloe Sevigny as young gay women in a relationship. When ""Creek"" ended in 2003, Williams continued to seek out challenging fare: she was a young woman embroiled in a destructive relationship with friend Anna Friel in ""Me Without You"" (2001), and a small-town librarian involved with reclusive Peter Dinklage in ""The Station Agent"" (2003) before scoring a personal and professional triumph with Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005). Cast as Heath Ledger's long-suffering wife, she earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, while also forging a romantic relationship with Ledger that resulted in the birth of a daughter in 2005. Their union ran aground in 2007, one year before Ledger's tragic death from a prescription overdose; Williams found solace in her work, which included Todd Haynes's film about Bob Dylan, ""I'm Not There"" (2007) and Charlie Kaufman's unique ""Synecdoche, New York"" (2008), as well as a near-solo turn as a homeless woman in ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008). She capped this string of indies with a potent turn as a woman who committed infanticide in Martin Scorsese's supernatural thriller ""Shutter Island"" (2010) and as a woman in a troubled marriage to Ryan Gosling in Derek Cianfrance's ""Blue Valentine"" (2010), the latter of which earned her a second Oscar nomination. A third Academy nod would come the following year with her turn as Marilyn Monroe in ""My Week with Marilyn"" (2011), which Williams followed with a diverse collection of projects, from Sarah Polley's mature romance ""Take This Waltz"" (2011) to Sam Raimi's ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" (2012), which cast her as Glinda the Good Witch. The latter was chosen to appeal to her daughter, Mathilde Rose, and Williams' desire to provide a more constant presence in her life led to stage work that culminated in a 2014 Broadway run as Sally Bowles in Cabaret and a 2016 Tony nomination for Blackbird. She returned to films in 2016 as Casey Affleck's estranged wife in Kenneth Lonergan's ""Manchester by the Sea,"" which netted a fourth Oscar nomination. Its critical success spurred a flurry of activity by Williams, who moved swiftly from the lavish musical ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017) to Ridley Scott's troubled drama ""All the Money in the World"" (2018), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination as the mother of kidnapping victim J. Paul Getty. A rare foray into big-budget genre films came with ""Venom"" (2018), an adaptation of the Marvel Comics series with Tom Hardy, provided her with the highest-grossing film of her career, which she followed with an English-language remake of ""After the Wedding"" (2019). Williams then returned to television for the first time since ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"" for ""Fosse/Verdon,"" a miniseries based on the tumultuous lives and careers of choreographer and filmmaker Bob Fosse (played by Sam Rockwell) and dancer Gwen Verdon. As Verdon, Williams won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series. While filming, Williams began dating director Thomas Kail;it was announced in December 2019 that the couple had gotten engaged and that Williams was pregnant with her second child."

Born in New York City in 1965 to playwright Patricia Broderick and actor James Broderick, Broderick began studying acting at HB Studio, appearing in plays alongside his father. Impressing the directors and writers of the theater community with his performances, Broderick was soon appearing off-Broadway with Harvey Fierstein in a 1982 production of ""Torch Song Trilogy."" He made his Broadway debut the following year in Neil Simon's ""Brighton Beach Memoirs,"" the same year he also made his film debut in ""Max Dugan Returns"" (1983) and ""WarGames"" (1983), capping off the year with a Tony award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. He returned to Broadway to star in Simon's ""Biloxi Blues"" (1985) before landing the role of Ferris Bueller, which instantly took him from moderate fame to movie-star status. Then in 1987, Broderick was vacationing in Northern Ireland when he accidentally veered into the wrong lane, hitting another car in a massive head-on collision. Both the driver and passenger in the other car were killed instantly, and Broderick suffered a concussion, a fractured leg, fractured ribs, and a collapsed lung. Broderick was unable to remember the crash or the circumstances surrounding it, and was fined $175 for careless driving. It would take the better part of the year for him to recover, but he made a strong creative return, starring in the film adaptation of ""Biloxi Blues"" (1988) and co-starring with Denzel Washington in the acclaimed Civil War drama ""Glory"" (1989). Being so strongly tied to the Ferris Bueller, a character iconic to the 1980s, at first made it challenging for Broderick to find his footing as an actor in the first half of the 1990s, and films like ""Out on a Limb"" (1992) and ""The Night We Never Met"" (1993) failed to make an impact. But by 1994, Broderick was hitting his stride once again, providing the voice of Simba in the monumental Disney hit ""The Lion King"" (1994). He returned to Broadway the next year to star in ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' (1997) alongside fellow stage-to-screen actor Sarah Jessica Parker, whom he married two years later. Broderick won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance, and he would continue to oscillate between Hollywood and the New York stage, memorably appearing in ""The Cable Guy' (1996) and the black comedy ""Election"" (1999), as well as starring on Broadway in ""Night Must Fall"" and ""Taller Than a Dwarf."" In 2001, Broderick starred with Nathan Lane in a smash hit Broadway musical adaptation of the classic Mel Brooks comedy film ""The Producers"" (1967).

The first sign of trouble came with what was intended to be her breakout movie, ""Rounders"" (1998). That film underperformed at the box office and left Mol the subject of indifference from an industry that sought to build her up in the first place. Both determined and resilient, Mol continued to plow forward with her career, playing Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend in Woody Allen's ""Celebrity"" (1998) and Marion Davies in ""Cradle Will Rock"" (1999). She enjoyed roles in the remake of ""Picnic"" (CBS, 2000) before performing in a London stage production of Neil LaBute's ""The Shape of Things"" (2001), a role she reprised in the director's 2003 film adaptation. After struggling to regain her footing, Mol finally broke through with an acclaimed performance in the title role of the indie biopic ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" (2006). From there, she co-starred opposite Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in ""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007) and had a short-lived regular role on the U.S. remake of ""Life on Mars"" (ABC, 2009). Finding new life on the small screen, Mol had a recurring role as a showgirl and mother on the critically acclaimed ""Boardwalk Empire"" (HBO, 2010-14), a testament to her ability to shed an image as a flavor of the month."
1804,Kenneth Lonergan,10/16/1962,"New York, New York, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/OWocqh_SERNGEIBLW9lAJ1mA3pE=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/212796_v9_bb.jpg,"Known for his insightful character studies and unique ability to draw real drama out of the outwardly mundane, writer-director Kenneth Lonergan boasted a career that was, in many ways, both impressive and surprising. After attracting significant early attention as a member of New York's Naked Angels theater company with his acerbic and insightful comedy-drama ""This is Our Youth"" in 1996, Lonergan earned his first screen credit as one of writers on the Robert De Niro-Billy Crystal hit comedy ""Analyze This"" (1999). After taking on a purely mercenary writing assignment for the film adaptation of ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" (2000), Lonergan displayed his true passion and understated talent with the low-key, but impactful family drama ""You Can Count on Me"" (2000). The film went on to earn widespread acclaim and helped launch the film career of longtime Lonergan friend and collaborator, Mark Ruffalo. Further stage works like 2000's ""The Waverly Gallery"" and script contributions to Martin Scorsese's sweeping ""Gangs of New York"" (2002) solidified the consensus that he was indeed an artist to watch. And then, nothing, until his sophomore feature film effort - filmed in 2005 - ""Margaret"" (2011) was given a limited release six years later, due to a bitter dispute between the writer-director and the studio over the movie's running time. Any bad feeling from that experience were likely swept away by the reception afforded his next film, the searing family drama ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016), a commercial and critical success that brought Lonergan the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as well as a Best Actor award for leading man Casey Affleck. While not the most prolific filmmaker of his generation, audiences could always count on a thought-provoking look at the lives of identifiable characters in any Lonergan offering."

Whether playing a combative mathematics genius, a serial killer hunting the rich and famous or a lethal spy unable to recall his identity, Damon built a strong and respected career tackling characters against type. After appearing in several supporting roles, Damon forged his own path with best friend Ben Affleck by writing and starring in ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997), which earned the duo an Academy Award for Best Screenplay while opening numerous doors. From there, he delivered a brief but acclaimed performance as the titular soldier in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), followed by a more devious part as a social-climbing killer in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" (1999). Though he stalled a bit with ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" (2000) and ""All the Pretty Horses"" (2000), Damon became a bona fide star by aptly trading one-liners with the likes of George Clooney and Brad Pitt in the stylish action comedy ""Ocean's Eleven"" (2001) and its sequels. But Damon became his own man with ""The Bourne Identity"" (2002), which allowed him to solo drive a successful action franchise that earned big box-office dollars and critical acclaim across the board. By the time he landed a meaty leading role in Martin Scorsese's Oscar-winning thriller, ""The Departed"" (2006), Damon was one of the biggest stars working in Hollywood. Between crowd-pleasing hits like ""Interstellar"" (2014), ""The Martian"" (2015) and Jason Bourne"" (2016), quirkier work including his continued collaborations with Soderbergh and Clooney on films like ""Contagion"" (2011) and ""The Monuments Men"" (2014) and films such as Alexander Payne's science fiction satire ""Downsizing"" (2017), plus a handful of high-profile flops such as Cameron Crowe's ""We Bought a Zoo"" (2011) and Chinese-made action drama ""The Great Wall"" (2017), Damon became one of the most consistently surprising and interesting leading men in Hollywood."

Murnau,1888-12-28,"Bielefeld, North-Rhine-Westphalia, Germany",https://resizing.flixster.com/4GRdgN61MHwp4XlsV1ObeLJ9RQk=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/140590_v9_ba.jpg,"Though perhaps best known for the nightmarish Gothic-Expressionist horror ""Nosferatu"" (1922), German director F.W. Murnau's other films, which include the melodramas ""The Last Laugh"" (1924) and his first Hollywood effort, the Oscar-winning ""Sunrise"" (1927), showed him to be a master craftsman who helped to set the bar for visual storytelling in the 20th century and beyond. Born Fredrich Wilhelm Plumpe on December 28, 1888 in the German city of Bielefeld, he was raised with his two brothers in Kassel, where as a boy, Murnau often put on plays in his family's home.  Theater remained in his blood throughout his education - while studying literature and history at the University of Munich, he adopted the stage name ""Murnau"" for his debut in a 1909 production of ""Das Mirakel"" at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theatre. Reinhardt later invited him to work with him as an assistant director, but the experience was put on hold with the outbreak of World War I. Murnau served in the Imperial German Flying Corps and flew missions over France before a flight, misdirected by fog, brought him to neutral Switzerland and internment in a POW camp. While there, he acted in and directed several stage plays, and received his introduction to film by assisting in the production of propaganda films for the German embassy. Upon the end of the war, Murnau returned to German, where he established a production company, Murnau Veidt Filmgesellschaft, with actor Conrad Veidt. Their first film, ""Der Knabe in Blau"" (""The Boy in Blue"", 1919), was inspired by the Thomas Gainsborough painting, and was quickly followed by a slew of melodramas, often inspired by classic literature and other films of the day, including ""Satanas"" (1919), which drew upon D.W. Griffith's epic ""Intolerance"" (1916), and ""Der Janus-Koph"" (""The Janus Head,"" 1920), an adaptation of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde that did not credit author Robert Louis Stevenson. The best-known, and one of the few surviving titles from this period was ""Nosferatu"" (1922), an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula that, like ""Janus-Koph,"" failed to accredit its author. Its blend of Gothic horror - as personified by star Max Schreck's eerie turn as the bald, talon-sporting Count Orlok - and naturalistic settings, which contrasted with the trend towards expressionism in German cinema, won critical praise, but the film was hit with a lawsuit from Stoker's estate over failure to obtain rights to the novel, which required that all prints be destroyed, though a single print, distributed globally, allowed ""Nosferatu"" to survive. Murnau's other enduring film from this period was ""Der Letzte Mann"" (""The Last Laugh,"" 1924), which traced the downward spiral of a proud hotel doorman (Emil Jannings) who is demoted to washroom attendant; the film helped to change the visual language of film through its use of a subjective camera perspective to show Jannings' perception of his changing world. Murnau would complete two more films in Germany, including ""Faust"" (1926), an epic fantasy with remarkable special effects that made it the most expensive film by its production company, UFA, until the release of ""Metropolis"" in 1927. He then emigrated to the United States at the behest of producer William Fox; there, Murnau directed one of his most triumphant efforts, the drama ""Sunrise"" (1927), which brought German Expressionism and innovative camerawork to Hollywood productions. Though critically praised and the recipient of three Academy Awards, including the first-ever Best Picture Oscar, ""Sunrise"" was not a box office success, and failed to recoup the colossal price tag required for its huge, dreamlike sets. His next two films were met with studio interference - the now-lost ""Four Devils"" (1928), a tragedy set in the world of the circus, was altered to reflect a more upbeat ending, while ""Our Daily Bread"" (1930) was renamed ""City Girl"" and hastily adapted to include synchronous sound. Neither were successes, and Murnau soon left Fox to team with documentarian Robert Flaherty to make ""Tabu"" (1931), a documentary with fictionalized elements that attempted to display the challenges of South Sea Islanders adapting to the encroachment of Western civilization. Beautifully lensed by cinematographer Floyd Crosby, ""Tabu"" was not without its own set of problems - Flaherty left the film over amicable disagreements regarding the focus of the film with Murnau, who had financed the entire project out of his own pocket - but its lush imagery and exotic locations helped to provide the director with his first financially profitable film in America. However, Murnau would not live to reap the benefits from this long-overdue success: one week prior to its release, Murnau was involved in a car accident while driving up the California coast. He was the only passenger to suffer traumatic injuries, from which he succumbed on March 11, 1931. Though only 12 of his 21 films survived the passage of time, those titles - ""Nosferatu,"" ""Faust,"" ""Sunrise"" and ""Tabu"" - kept alive Murnau's status as an innovator in the history of cinema."

He was an excellent choice to play period villains in films like ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Captain Blood"" (1935), and ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), and Rathbone proved so effective, typecasting seemed inevitable. However, he staved off such a career fate with his indelible portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's master of deduction, Sherlock Holmes. From ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" (1939) through ""Dressed to Kill"" (1946) and seven seasons on radio, Rathbone did a superb job of communicating Holmes' unmatchable intelligence and sleuthing mastery. Rathbone eventually tired of the role and returned to the stage, which offered him a richer venue for his talents than acting as foils for comedians like Bob Hope and Danny Kaye and the rote villainy of low-budget horrors like ""The Black Sleep"" (1956). At the height of his craft, Rathbone performed with a degree of vividness and sincerity that was a hallmark of the finest classically-trained actors and his interpretation of Holmes was considered the definitive take on the literary icon."

Comfortable in the sackcloth of a country cleric, as in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938) opposite Errol Flynn and ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940) with Tyrone Power, Pallette was most widely seen in business attire, playing a Beltway fixer stumped by Senate do-gooder James Stewart in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939), and the patriarch of a wacky Depression-era family in the screwball classic ""My Man Godfrey"" (1936). Larger than life on the big screen, Pallette was no less outsized in his private life, where he allegedly opposed racial integration and was an early champion of Adolf Hitler. Growing fearful of an impending atomic Armageddon, Pallette stockpiled supplies on an Oregon compound but died of cancer in Hollywood in 1954. The memory of his unpalatable politics lost to time, Pallette lived on in the hearts of moviegoers as an indispensable element of Hollywood's Golden Age, a versatile character actor who could speak for the masses or drown out its voice with his own."

He grew up singing in the church choir, inspiring him to pursue a musical career, studying opera in Paris before being drawn to acting when hired as an understudy for the 1903 Broadway production of ""Glad of It."" Sticking to the stage, his star rose over the next few years, paving the way for his transition into leading roles in numerous silent films, beginning in 1914. In the '20s, he returned to the Great White Way until sound entered the picture, after which he slipped back into features, lending his well-trained pipes and dignified good looks to strong supporting parts such as Lord Montague in George Cukor's 1936 version of ""Romeo and Juliet."" He was a regular player in Errol Flynn's costume dramas, including ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" as well as the films of Preston Sturges, such as ""Sullivan's Travels."" While he was commonly cast as military officials or distinguished gentlemen, he occasionally found more interesting fare such as the overwrought Shakespearean actor in the Humphrey Bogart gem, ""In a Lonely Place."" Working into his 80s, he shifted primarily into small screen roles in his golden years, filling guest spots on such hit series as ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Dr. Kildare."""

Perhaps his awkward professional start in ill-suited endeavors like a stint as a cast member on the ""Mickey Mouse Club"" (Disney Channel, 1988-1995) and the short-lived fantasy series ""Young Hercules"" (Fox, 1998-99) also provided fodder for the disaffected roles the young actor would later craft with such voracity. Turns in higher-profile romantic dramas such as ""The Notebook"" (2004), combined with much publicized relationships with co-stars like Rachel McAdams brought Gosling a certain amount of heartthrob celebrity, although the actor doggedly avoided the ""Hollywood Star"" persona. After a brief absence from the screen in the late 2000s, Gosling reappeared at decade's end with two hard to classify performances - first, in the fact-based murder mystery ""All Good Things"" (2010), then in the romantic drama ""Blue Valentine"" (2010), the latter of which was a small, independent labor of love that earned him critical raves. With his stoic performance as an unnamed antihero in the neo-noir ""Drive"" (2011), Gosling had firmly established himself as one Hollywood's most interesting and unpredictable rising actors. Moving with ease from moody dramas like ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (2012) and the knockabout comedy of '70s-set action flick ""The Nice Guys"" (2016) to the old-school Hollywood glamour of romantic musical ""La La Land"" (2016) and gritty, philosophical science fiction with ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), Ryan Gosling seemingly could do anything and do it brilliantly."
1866,John Legend,12/28/1978,"Springfield, Ohio, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/yQE1ulcIHLVc2M9tlHaIjtC2q_0=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/499578_v9_bb.jpg,"John Legend's brand of classy, soulful and politically-engaged music filled a niche on the contemporary R&B scene, beginning with his critically successful debut album Get Lifted (2004). The album marked the first time that mainstream music lovers heard Legend's smooth vocals bringing a certain suavity to hip-hop soul, most notably in the hit single ""Ordinary People."" Legend's sophomore release, Once Again (2006), exceeded the commercial and critical success that he enjoyed with his first album. Instead of shooting for a blend of soul, pop, and hip-hop as he did in his first release, the Grammy Award-winning singer headed for a more innovative, adult contemporary direction on Once Again, which featured the catchy mid-tempo ""Save Room"" and the rock-laced song ""Stereo."" Legend showcased his political convictions and maturing sound on albums such as Wake Up! (2010), a collaboration with hip-hop group The Roots and a solid effort from an undeniably versatile musician and vocal powerhouse. This social conscience led to Legend's greatest success, co-writing the Academy Award-winning ""Glory"" with rapper Common for the soundtrack to the civil rights drama ""Selma (2014). He was born John Stephens on Dec. 28, 1978 in Springfield, OH. At an early age, Legend started playing gospel and classical piano under the tutelage of his grandmother. He attended Springfield North High School, where he graduated as salutatorian at age 16, before going off to attend the University of Pennsylvania as an English major. While in college, Legend put in time honing his budding music career by recording CDs with an a capella group, performing solo at various talent shows and open mic nights, and working as the music and choir director at Bethel A.M.E. Church in Scranton. It was during this time when Legend met hip-hop and R&B artist Lauryn Hill, who gave him his first big break by asking him to play the piano on her hit single ""Everything is Everything"" (1998). Helping his exposer, he was also making the rounds on the nightclub circuit in New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. Legend was performing as an independent artist and distributing both his self-titled demo album (2000) and Live At Jimmy's Uptown (2001) when he was introduced by his college roommate to the then-emerging hip-hop artist Kanye West, who signed Legend as the first artist on his Getting Out Our Dreams (G.O.O.D.) label. In 2004, Legend released his official debut album Get Lifted to critical acclaim, thanks in part to the hit single ""Ordinary People,"" a song which he originally wrote for the Black Eyed Peas. The LP went on to win three Grammy Awards in 2006 for Best R&B Album, Best R&B Male Vocal Performance, and the coveted Best New Artist honor. On Legend's sophomore release, Once Again, he collaborated with a stable of talented producers including West and Peas' frontman, will.i.am, to produce another critically-lauded, ballad-driven album with a more adult contemporary sound, evidenced with songs such as the mid-tempo, piano-based love ballad ""Save Room"" and the Grammy Award-winning track ""Heaven (Only Knows). It also featured one of Legend's more upbeat tracks, ""PDA (We Just Don't Care), about public displays of affection. While Once Again lifted Legend's career to new heights, it also made the singer the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit in 2011. Songwriter Anthony Stokes alleged that Legend's song ""Maxine's Interlude"" was based on a demo track that he gave Legend following the singer's concert in 2004. Stokes claimed that he never heard back from Legend after he gave him the track and was taken aback after hearing Legend's single ""Maxine's Interlude"" on the Once Again album. In between song recordings, concert tours and live performances, Legend also dabbled in acting, guest starring on the musical drama series ""American Dreams"" (NBC, 2002-05), where he portrayed Stevie Wonder, and on the HBO comedy series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (2000-2011) as himself. He also collaborated with established artists over the years, including West, Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige, Fergie, and Pink. For his next major release, Legend and hip-hop/neo soul band The Roots teamed up to record Wake Up!, a politically-profound R&B album where they covered songs pulled from '60s and '70s soulful music such as Marvin Gaye's ""Wholy Holy"" (1971) and Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes' ""Wake Up Everybody"" (1975). It also featured Legend's original composition, ""Shine,"" which was included on the soundtrack to the educational reform documentary ""Waiting for 'Superman'"" (2010). In 2011, Legend announced his engagement to American model Chrissy Teigen, whom he had begun dating in 2007. That same year, the singer's hit song ""Save Room"" was included on the soundtrack to the romantic comedy ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" starring Ryan Gosling and Steve Carrell. In 2012, Legend landed a regular television gig on ""Duets"" (ABC, 2012), a reality competition show where seasoned artists mentored, judged, and performed with aspiring singers, all of whom were competing for a recording contract. The following year, Legend released his fourth album, Love in the Future, which featured the hit single ""All of Me."" Legend teamed with rapper Common to write the song ""Glory"" for the soundtrack to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. biopic ""Selma"" (2014); the collaboration won Best Original Song at the 2015 Academy Awards. Legend followed with the album Darkness and Light (2016) and continued his work in film, co-starring in and providing music for the romantic musical ""La La Land"" (2016) and duetting on the theme song of the live-action ""Beauty and the Beast"" (2017) with Ariana Grande. The following year, Legend starred in the title role of a live concert production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" (NBC 2018) that aired on Easter Sunday."

Following years of increasingly larger roles on the stage and on the small screen, it was an unusual family connection that provided her first major break into feature films. As the great granddaughter of the film's subject, boxer James J. Braddock, DeWitt landed a plum role in Ron Howard's Depression-era bio, ""Cinderella Man"" (2005). Taking her Hollywood shot, DeWitt went on to demonstrate her mix of comedic and dramatic chops in a variety of big and small screen projects, standing out as the face-to-watch with her take on the romantically-inclined hostage negotiator Emily Lehman on the Fox series ""Standoff"" (2006-07), starring opposite future husband, Ron Livingston. After earning wider attention for her recurring role as Don Draper's bohemian lover on ""Mad Men"" (AMC, 2007-15), DeWitt earned widespread award attention for her supporting turn in ""Rachel Getting Married"" (2008). From there, she delivered a capable turn in ""The Company Men"" (2010) and spent three seasons as Toni Collette's self-absorbed sister on the critically acclaimed comedy ""The United States of Tara"" (Showtime, 2009-2011).

After a run of shows on Broadway and in touring productions, Simmons began making small appearances in films like ""The Ref"" (1994) and ""The Scout"" (1994). The talented actor was also landing parts on various television series, most notably two recurring, diametrically-opposed characters appearing simultaneously on two different shows. On the brutal prison drama ""OZ"" (HBO, 1997-2003), Simmons played a white supremacist with frightening authenticity, while on ""Law & Order"" (NBC, 1990-2010) he was the embodiment of empathy and rationality as state psychiatrist Dr. Emil Skoda. Steadily gaining prominence in a variety of feature film work, Simmons landed the plum role of cantankerous tabloid editor J. Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" (2002), earning high marks from legions of comic book fans. In addition to reprising the part for ""Spider-Man"" sequels, Simmons was seemingly everywhere, popping up in the features ""Thank You for Smoking"" (2006), ""Juno"" (2007) and ""Burn After Reading"" (2008). Transcending the category of character actor, Simmons became a welcome addition to any cast, ensuring a performance that was often affecting, frequently surprising, and always memorable. He unexpectedly made the move to mainstream star when his powerful performance in the drama ""Whiplash"" (2014) won him Best Supporting Actor awards at both the Golden Globes and the Oscars.

Sharing the same laid back affability and easy smile as well as similar physical attributes, the two would come together, with Scott fittingly making his big screen debut co-starring with his childhood idol in Hanks' feature directorial bow ""That Thing You Do!"" (1996). The newcomer proved well cast as Guy Patterson, the charismatic drummer whose band climbs the 1964 pop charts in the amiable period comedy. A Massachusetts native who started out acting in high school productions and worked at a Rhode Island Renaissance fair, Scott began his college career with practicality in mind, and started out as a communications major before switching to drama studies during his second year. The die cast, he moved to NYC and started a theater company (aTheaterCo) with three college chums. Scott supported himself waiting tables before finding work in TV commercials. Episodic guest shots followed, with NBC's popular legal series ""Law & Order"" hosting his small screen debut. A 1995 recurring role on ""Grace Under Fire"" featured him as the son that Brett Butler's title character gave up for adoption and made him a familiar face to viewers of the highly rated sitcom."

Music then became the subject of his award-winning short--and then later feature--â€³Whiplash.â€³ Born in Rhode Island in 1985, Chazelle grew up in both France and America; his comfort with two cultures strongly informed his film work. He began his first film, a short entitled â€³Guy and Madeline on a Park Benchâ€³ (2009), as his thesis for his Masters at Harvard in Visual and Environmental Studies. Over the next two years, he developed it into a full length feature, utilizing friends and a 16mm camera to tell the story of a woman and a jazz musician. After graduation he moved out to Los Angeles with a plan to connect with the film studios through his work as a screenplay writer for hire. By 2009 he had taken â€³Guy and Madeline on a Park Benchâ€³ to festivals where it gained some notice and several awards including recognition as an emerging artist at the Denver International Film Festival and a Jury Special Prize at the Torino International Film Festival. He continued to hone his writing skills as a screenwriter in Hollywood and began to write his next feature, â€³Whiplashâ€³ (2013). This film was much more personal, an insider's dark look at the powerful emotions and obsessions that drive music students. As a former student at musical academies, it was a subject he knew quite well. When he found the script a tough sell, he listened to advice and took a scene from it to develop as a short film. The short created buzz across the 2013 film festival circuit and won numerous awards including the Short Film Jury Prize at Sundance. New interest in the original led to the feature-length script being included on the coveted â€³Black Listâ€³ of unproduced films considered by studios. With this help, funding was secured and the feature-length film â€³Whiplashâ€³ was produced, winning awards and acclaim from Sundance to Cannes. Chazelle's next project moved even further into his love of music: ""La La Land"" (2016) was a full-fledged musical, with elaborate song and dance numbers throughout. Stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling did all their own singing and dancing as a struggling actress and idealistic jazz pianist. The critically acclaimed box office hit scored 14 Oscar nominations, tying the record set by ""All About Eve"" (1951) and ""Titanic"" (1997), and won six, including Best Original Score, Best Original Song (for the film's love theme ""City of Stars""), Best Director and Best Actress. In one of the most shocking moments in Oscar history, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced that ""La La Land"" had won Best Picture and producer Jordan Horowitz was most of the way through his acceptance speech before it was revealed that a mistake had been made: the true winner of the Best Picture award was indie drama ""Moonlight"" (2016)."

Born on April 14, 1957 in Pikesville, MD, to a schoolteacher mother and a shoe salesman father, Platt first set his sights on becoming a lawyer, graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1979, and getting his masters in law from New York University. Platt spent a few years as an entertainment lawyer before he got the producing bug. He started out in theater, as an associate producer on the play ""Total Abandon"" (1983), before moving into Hollywood and taking an executive producer credit on the college comedy ""Campus Man"" (1987). Throughout the nineties, Platt put in time at studios such as Orion Pictures, TriStar Pictures, and Universal Studios, before starting his own production company, Marc Platt Productions. The early 2000s gave Platt some huge successes on both stage and screen, in the form of the smash hit Broadway musical ""Wicked"" and the Reese Witherspoon law comedy ""Legally Blonde"" (2001) and its sequel, ""Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde"" (2003). The rest of the decade saw Platt producing a wide variety of titles, from the Anne Hathaway indie drama ""Rachel Getting Married"" (2008) to the Fellini-inspired musical ""Nine"" (2009), and from the stylish neo-noir of ""Drive"" (2011) to the ludicrous shoot-em-up ""2 Guns"" (2013). Platt hit pay dirt, however, when he co-produced Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" (2016), a splashy romantic homage to classic movie musicals that scored big at the box office and swept the 89th Academy Awards, earning 14 nominations, a record tied with ""All About Eve"" (1950) and ""Titanic"" (1997) for most nominations for a single film. On Oscar night, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway declared ""La La Land"" to be the winner for Best Picture, as almost all awards prognosticators had predicted. However, viewers watched in shock when, as Platt was giving his acceptance speech, it was revealed that the presenters had been given the wrong envelope, and that the actual Best Picture winner was ""Moonlight"" (2016), a quiet, micro budgeted drama about black LGBT youth. Platt and company graciously ceded the stage to the cast and crew of ""Moonlight,"" unintentionally creating a Hollywood moment that would be discussed and analyzed forever."

Before long, however, Cross was longing to work in the realm of large-scale feature films, so he relocated to Los Angeles. Cross was hungry to get involved in the L.A. movie scene, even briefly volunteering his services for free at Corman Studios, just to gain experience. He spent several years continuing his work as an assistant editor, gradually working his way up to impressive projects like Ang Lee's ""Ride with the Devil"" (1999). In 2005, he joined the editing team of the acclaimed series ""Deadwood"" (HBO, 2004-06). By 2010, Cross was finally ready to move from assistant editor to editor, cutting the drama ""The Space Between"" (2010). His work on ""Whiplash"" (2014) would prove to be some of the most challenging he had ever faced, as his selections and cuts made the instruments being played on screen sync to the music of the film's soundtrack.

In 1998, he relocated to Wisconsin, where he attended Nicolet High School before enrolling in music study at Harvard University. There, he met Chazelle, an aspiring filmmaker with whom he bonded over a shared love of music. The pair roomed together and performed in a local band before setting to work on their first collaborative film effort, ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" (2009), a bittersweet romance about a jazz musician and an introverted young woman. Hurwitz wrote all of the music for Chazelle's film, which earned solid reviews on the festival circuit and a limited theatrical release in 2010. With a completed feature under their belt, the pair moved to Los Angeles, where Hurwitz wrote the script and songs for an episode of ""The Simpsons"" (Fox, 1989- ), among other television project. He then reunited with Chazelle for ""Whiplash"" (2014), an intense drama about an aspiring jazz musician (Miles Teller) and his complicated relationship with a talented but abusive teacher. The film was a critical success, earning three Oscars (including Best Supporting Actor for Simmons), and provided Chazelle with the funding to complete his long-gestating dream project, a musical romance-fantasy titled ""La La Land."" Hurwitz again wrote the score, which featured songs written by Tony nominees Benj Pasek and Andy Paul; the film and its soundtrack were both enormously successful, with Hurwitz netting Oscars for Best Original Score and Best Original Song (""City of Stars""), among numerous other awards, as well as a chart-topping soundtrack album."

His performances in ""The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel"" (1951), ""A Star is Born"" (1954), ""North by Northwest"" (1959), and ""Lolita"" (1962) ranked amongst his very finest.

After five years as a cartoonist, Landau switched gears to become an actor, performing in live television productions before graduating to Hollywood features in the 1960s. Toward the latter half of that precarious decade, he landed his first truly memorable role, playing master of disguise Rollin Hand on the hit spy series ""Mission: Impossible"" (CBS, 1966-1973). Though the show lasted for seven seasons, Landau left after the third because of a contractual dispute, a move that left the actor struggling to find quality roles for almost two decades. Landau had a particularly rough time during the 1980s despite steady work, mainly as a one-dimensional villain in projects more concerned with car chases and explosions than character or story. He finally re-emerged with Oscar-nominated roles in ""Tucker: The Man and His Dream"" (1988) and ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" (1989), eventually winning his first Academy Award for his spot-on portrayal of aging silent film star Bela Lugosi in ""Ed Wood"" (1994), all of which paved the way for higher profile projects for an actor always capable of quality performances.

He appeared in some of America's best-loved television comedies, including ""I Love Lucy"" -- in which his second wife, Vivian Vance, had a recurring role -- and ""I Dream of Jeannie."" Film buffs, however, will likely recall Ober best for small but key roles in a couple of classics.

Tierney emerged as a leading lady of equal beauty and depth. Gliding seamlessly from smoldering sensuality in Preminger's ""Laura"" (1944), to sang froid psychopathy in John M. Stahl's ""Leave Her to Heaven"" (1945), to a maturity and grace far beyond her years in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" (1947), Tierney attained a strata of celebrity that put her on par with fellow sirens Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner and Ava Gardner."
1912,Clifton Webb,1889-11-19,"Indianapolis, Indiana, USA",https://resizing.flixster.com/N77j2QKl9YplSFBCJFKfU1llS10=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/13457_v9_ba.jpg,"With his trademark pencil mustache and attitude of thinly-veiled disdain, Clifton Webb was a blast of asexual sophistication during Hollywood's testosterone-fueled postwar epoch. A ballroom dancer and stage actor who contributed appearances to some silent and early sound films, Webb made a belated return to cinema with an Oscar-nominated performance in Otto Preminger's ""Laura"" (1944), as acidic murder suspect Waldo Lydecker. Character and actor were so well-matched that Webb would go on to play a string of similarly supercilious supporting and principal characters in a film career as brilliant as it was brief. Effete to the extreme, he was nonetheless an imposing screen presence whose haughty mien could overshadow such manly leads as William Holden, Dana Andrews, Alan Ladd and Tyrone Power while stealing focus from the luscious likes of Gene Tierney, Ginger Rogers, Lauren Bacall and Sophia Loren. The actor's barely concealed homosexuality precluded him from playing many Hollywood husbands, but he proved a surprisingly persuasive paterfamilias, most notably in the family comedy ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (1950) and in the proto disaster flick ""Titanic"" (1953), in which Webb and onscreen wife Barbara Stanwyck put aside their differences in a desperate bid to save their children from death at sea. Long devoted to his aging mother, with whom he lived and who passed away in 1960, Webb retired from acting in 1962. His death in 1966 robbed Hollywood of one of its most unforgettable characters, both on and offscreen."

Born into a wealthy family with descendants tracing back to the Mayflower, Price grew up in relative privilege and comfort. As a child he attended an elite prepratory school in Connecticut, before going off to study art history at Yale. Price would eventually go on to earn a degree in art history from the university, and had every intention of pursuing his masters in the subject. But, as fate would have it, he developed a keen interest in the stage shortly after graduation, and thus, decided to pursue a career in acting. As an actor, Price was first draw to the stage, and began appearing in plays in the mid-1930s. Price honed his fledgling acting craft on the stage by appearing in several more plays, before turning his attention to film acting. He began appearing in films in the late 30s, and by the mid-1940s Price was making a name for himself with supporting roles in noir classics like ""Laura"" (1944). Although Price would go on to appear in a myriad of film genres throughout his career, however, it was the horror genre that he'd be most remembered for. Price made several horror films throughout his career, most notably ""Dragonwyck"" (1946), ""House of Wax"" (1953), and ""The Fly"" (1958). By the early 1960s he began working with the legendary B-movie producer Roger Corman, and throughout the decade made several low budget horror films with Corman, including ""House of Usher"" (1960), ""Tales of Terror"" (1962), ""The Raven"" (1963), and ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" (1964). By the late 1960s and well into the 70s and 80s, Price relegated himself to guest appearances on TV shows as well as voice over work. As Price's film acting career declined, his earlier work in the horror genre only grew in appreciation amongst the genre's diehard fans, one of whom was a young director named Tim Burton. In 1982 Burton would go on to make a tribute short film to Price called ""Vincent"" (1982) (which Price narrated), and would also cast him in his 1990 film ""Edward Scisscorhands"" (1990). Price's role in Burton's Oscar-nominated fantasy romance would prove to be his last. After being diagnosed with emphysema, Price died from lung cancer on October 25, 1993. He was 82."

James Flavin is one of the reasons this character became ingrained in the public's consciousness. Flavin appeared in more than 400 films in a career that stretched over half a century, frequently playing policemen or other authority figures, often in uncredited roles. In reality only a quarter Irish, Flavin was a former West Point student who fell into acting in 1929 while living in Portland, Maine. Flavin tried to break into the New York Theater but had more success when he ventured west to work in the film industry. He landed the lead in the now-lost '32 serial ""The Airmail Mystery,"" but it was to be his only leading role. Instead, Flavin was ubiquitous in tiny roles, including small parts in the '33 version of ""King Kong"" (playing a ship's mate) and John Ford's classic ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (playing a guard). Television was also kind to Flavin; he made over 100 appearances between the mid-'50s and the mid-'70s. His final role was one of his more prestigious: playing President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the '76 TV docudrama ""Francis Gary Powers: The True Story of the U-2 Spy Incident."" Flavin died in '76, a few weeks before his wife Lucille Brown, who had been his leading lady in his first film, 54 years earlier."

With his theatre work in Vienna having attracted attention from Broadway and Tinseltown, Preminger sailed to America in 1935 to begin a long relationship with Twentieth Century Fox. Preminger directed several films before leaving Hollywood for New York, where his stage work drew critical huzzahs and a return ticket to Hollywood. This time Preminger scored with the proto-noir ""Laura"" (1944), which netted him an Oscar nomination. A string of stylish thrillers, including ""Black Angel"" (1945) and ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" (1950), established him as a world-class filmmaker. Dying in 1986 from the ravages of Alzheimer's disease, Preminger's legacy endured, due to the legend of his larger-than-life personality, his unforgettable physical presence, and the films he had created during his lifetime."

He received stellar reviews for his turn in the show, which then led to his casting as a brave son aiding his mother (Naomi Watts) in finding his father (Ewan McGregor) and brothers in the wake of the 2004 Asian tsunami in ""The Impossible."" Critical response was again overwhelmingly in favor of Holland, who was soon mentioned in critical circles as a serious contender for the Best Actor Oscar. Holland soon graduated to starring roles in other features, including taking over the role of Spider-Man as the character was integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, underscoring his status as a star in the making in two distinctly different mediums. Born Thomas Stanley Holland in the southwest London borough of Kingston upon Thames, England on June 1, 1996, Tom Holland was the eldest of four sons by comedian Dominic Anthony Holland and his wife, Nicola. Tom attended Donhead Prep School before entering Wimbledon College. While there, he took a hip-hop dance class, where choreographer Lynne Page first spotted him. An associate of Peter Darling, who choreographed both the film version of ""Billy Elliot"" (2003) and its musical adaptation, Page put Holland through two years of training before he made his West End debut as Billy's best friend, Michael, in ""Billy Elliot the Musical"" in 2008. He soon advanced to the title role, winning rave reviews for his acting and dancing skills before departing the show in 2010 after performing for both Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the musical's composer, Elton John. In 2011, Holland was cast as Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts' son in ""The Impossible"" (2012), a harrowing drama about a Spanish couple and their children caught in the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Critics singled out his performance - his first acting turn in front of a camera - with near universal praise, as well as the Hollywood Spotlight Award from the Hollywood Film Awards. Coverage in Variety and Screen International included Holland in features about up-and-coming young actors, while Summit Entertainment, which distributed ""The Impossible,"" was reportedly campaigning to submit Holland for the Best Actor Oscar over McGregor. He was subsequently cast in a voiceover role for the Japanese animated film ""Arriety"" (2011) and earned his first starring role in ""How I Live Now"" (2013), a post-apocalyptic drama based on the novel of the same name by Meg Rossoff and co-starring Saorise Ronan. Holland next appeared in the miniseries ""Wolf Hall"" (BBC 2015), based on the historical bestseller by Hilary Mantel. In July 2015, Holland was announced as the next Spider-Man, with his character popping up in a cameo in ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) before the release of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017). In between, Holland co-starred in the drama ""Edge of Winter"" (2016), adolescent fantasy ""A Monster Calls"" (2016), and adventure drama ""The Lost City of Z"" (2016) before starring in Irish-made medieval drama ""Pilgrimage"" (2017)."

Jackson has since become a highly sought after actor and film producer.  Born in Washington, D.C.,he was a student activist at Morehouse College and served as an usher at the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His protests led to his being arrested and convicted of unlawful confinement. After finishing college, he moved to New York where his early stage and television career was stunted by substance abuse issues. After a number of small parts on television in the early '80s, Jackson's career finally began to find true traction thanks to his relationship with Spike Lee. The director cast him in parts in ""School Daze"" (1988),""Do the Right Thing"" (1989), and ""Mo' Better Blues"" (1990). Along with small, but memorable roles, in ""Coming to America"" (1988) and Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (1990), his profile in the industry began increasing. His true breakout came due to another collaboration with Lee. After having just completed a rehabilitation program for cocaine and heroin addiction, Jackson garnered critical raves as the drug-addicted brother of Wesley Snipes' architect in ""Jungle Fever"" (1991). His film roles increased steadily, including parts in Steven Spielberg's blockbuster ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and opposite Harrison Ford in the thriller ""Patriot Games"" (1992). It was a relationship with another director, however, that put the actor on the map for good. Having worked with Quentin Tarantino on ""True Romance"" (1993), he was cast in the filmmaker's seminal ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). Playing the Scripture-quoting hitman Jules, alongside John Travolta, the actor was swept up in a pop culture phenomenon. From then on, Jackson became an in-demand film actor. His high profile roles included joining Bruce Willis for ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995) and reteaming with Tarantino for ""Jackie Brown"" (1997). He also joined sci-fi lore by playing Jedi Master Mace Windu in George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" prequels, ""The Phantom Menace"" (1999), ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002), and ""Revenge of the Sith"" (2005). M. Night Shyamalan paired the actor once again with Willis for the supernatural thriller ""Unbreakable"" (2000) - a film that would eventually get a sequel 19 years later starring the pair again in ""Glass"" (2019). He later became one of the mainstays of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury. Beginning in ""Iron Man"" (2008) and continuing through the international blockbusters of ""The Avengers"" (2012) series and appearing as a younger version of the character in ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), Jackson played the hero to the point of becoming synonymous with the character. The actor continued his relationship with Tarantino as well, appearing in the director's ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015). Jackson's standing as an action star continued deep into his career as well, playing John Shaft in both ""Shaft"" (2000) and the sequel ""Shaft"" (2019), and teaming with Ryan Reynolds for ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" (2017) and ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" (2020)."

With screenwriter and director parents, and an equally talented and famous actor sister, Gyllenhaal used his inherent intelligence and sensitivity to make his name in independent films. As a teenager, Gyllenhaal lent a subtle, soulful sense of complicated youth to a number of acclaimed art-house titles, including ""Donnie Darko"" (2001), which emerged as a hit from the 2001 Sundance Film Festival and paved the way for his future career. As he matured into his twenties, Gyllenhaal was increasingly in demand for a wide range of material - from the small-town-set indie ""The Good Girl"" (2002) to Roland Emmerich's tentpole blockbuster ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004). He delivered one of his best performances in arguably the most controversial movie of his career, ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), which earned him his greatest critical acclaim to date. From there, Gyllenhaal developed into a prominent leading actor capable of turning in understated performances as he did as a San Francisco Chronicle reporter obsessively chasing down a killer in ""Zodiac"" (2007), while holding his own opposite Meryl Streep and Alan Arkin in ""Rendition"" (2007). Though he stumbled in his first blockbuster starring role with ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" (2010), Gyllenhaal remained a bankable star possessing the ability to excel in a myriad of different film genres. His compelling against-type performance in the noirish drama ""Nightcrawler"" (2014) was critically acclaimed, and was followed by star turns in boxing drama ""Southpaw"" (2015) and action drama ""Everest"" (2015)."

She proved her talent and career longevity, however, with her Oscar-nominated, subtle but complex turns in ""In the Bedroom"" (2001) and ""The Wrestler"" (2008), as well as strong performances in films ranging from romantic comedy ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"" (2011) to barbed satire ""The Big Short"" (2015) proving her worth to critics who had cruelly deemed her win for ""My Cousin Vinny"" to be a fluke, vindicating fans and critics who recognized her considerable talents all along."

Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii to Filipino parents, Batalon never intended on becoming an actor as a young boy. He was drawn to performance, however, and after high school enrolled in a local community college in Hawaii to study music theory. Batalon's interest in the subject was fleeting, however, and he soon dropped out. Wanting to pursue a new subject in the performing arts, but unsure of which one, Batalon soon discovered a two-year acting program at the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts. He applied to the program on a whim and was flabbergasted when he received word that he had been accepted. Batalon quickly packed his bags and moved to New York City, where it took him no time at all to fall in love with acting. Batalon studied intensely at the school over the next two years, and shortly before graduation was asked to audition for the role of Ned Leeds in the upcoming ""Spider-Man"" reboot. Batalon auditioned directly with Tom Holland, who was to play Spider-Man in the upcoming film, and the two clicked right away. He was then cast as Ned Leeds in the blockbuster reboot, which premiered in theaters in the summer of 2017. With his acting career hitting a high point relatively quickly, Batalon also nabbed parts in the films ""Every Day"" (2017) and ""The True Don Quixote"" (2018), the latter of which he played the legendary Sancho Panza."

A native of Anaheim, CA, Revolori came from a family where acting runs deep; both his older brother Mario and father, Mario Sr., were actors. In fact, it was with his brother that Tony made his acting debut - at the age of two - playing one of Santa's elves in a commercial for baby food. From there, Revolori appeared in TV shows such as ""Entourage"" (HBO 2004-2011) and ""My Name is Earl"" (NBC 2005-09). He shared the screen with his brother in the film ""The Perfect Game"" (2009) before once again picking up parts in shows such as the short-lived comedy ""Sons of Tuscon"" (Fox 2010) and the cable hit ""Shameless"" (Showtime 2011- ). His role in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014) was his first major gig, one earned over Mario as both Revolori brothers auditioned for the same part. Revolori next appeared in the critically-acclaimed indie comedy ""Dope"" (2015) as one of a trio of teenage outcasts who accidentally get caught up in a major drug deal."

A Melbourne, Australia resident, Rice was the daughter of director Jeremy Rice and writer Kate Rice. She began her career appearing in a number of shorts and television commercials, most notably Zak Hilditch's ""Transmission"" (2012), which received international attention at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rice's performance left an impression on Hilditch, as she was cast for the lead role in her feature film debut, Hilditch's follow up film ""These Final Hours"" (2013). The same year, she appeared in live-action sequences bookending the computer-animated film ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" (2013). Rice also made appearances on a number of Australian television shows throughout 2014 and 2015 such as ""The Doctor Blake Mysteries"" (ABC, 2013- ), ""Worst Year of My Life Again"" (ABC3, 2014), and ""Mako: Island of Secrets"" (Eleven, 2013- ). In 2016, she portrayed her first villain character in the feature film tie-in to fantasy adventure series ""Nowhere Boys"" (ABC3, 2013- ), ""Nowhere Boys: The Book of Shadows"" (2016). Rice's American breakthrough came in the Shane Black-directed '70s-set mystery ""The Nice Guys"" (2016) as Holly, the precocious pre-teen daughter of Ryan Gosling's character Holland March."

Starr first attracted attention as the geeky oddball Bill Haverchuck in the criminally-ignored ""Freaks and Geeks"" (NBC 1999-2000) and subsequently became a Frat Pack regular, stealing scenes in the likes of ""Knocked Up"" (2007), ""Superbad"" (2007) and ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" (2007). But it was on the small screen where Starr was allowed to truly showcase his talents, most notably as frustrated writer Roman DeBeers on ""Party Down"" (Starz 2009-10) and computer wizard Sam Stern on ""NTSF: SD:SUV::"" (Adult Swim 2011-13), while a string of guest parts on the likes of ""Parks and Recreation"" (NBC 2009-15), ""Community"" (NBC 2009-15; Yahoo!, 2015) and ""How I Met Your Mother"" (CBS 2005-14) further established his funnyman credentials."

Working alongside famed ""SNL"" alums such as Chris Rock, Adam Sandler and Tina Fey further increased Smoove's presence in show business. His pitch-perfect casting as Larry David's freeloading houseguest and sidekick on HBO's critically acclaimed series ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (HBO, 2000- ) was even hailed as one of television's funniest characters. Smoove turned his recurring role on ""Curb"" into a scene-stealing performance that helped establish his reputation as a well-rounded and sought-after comedian."

Soon after, he landed his first film role, starring in the coming-of-age drama ""The Land"" (2016). The next year he starred in two more films, including the Kyle Mooney dramedy ""Brigsby Bear"" (2017) and the Noah Wyle-starring drama ""Shot"" (2017).

A former model, she turned to acting at the dawn of the new millennium, experiencing near misses as a cast member on a pair of quickly canceled series - ""Special Unit 2"" (UPN, 2001-02) and ""Veritas: The Quest"" (ABC, 2003). More television work and the occasional small role in such feature films as ""Walking Tall,"" (2004) trickled in, but nothing substantial. That was until Smulders joined the ensemble cast of the relationship sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother"" (CBS, 2005-14). Working alongside Jason Segel, Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris, Smulders suddenly found herself in the enviable position of a highly-rated and critically-praised series. Still, participation in a major feature film eluded Smulders, with little more than the comedy ""The Slammin' Salmon"" (2009) populating that section of her rÃ©sumÃ©. That all changed when writer-director Joss Whedon cast her as super agent Maria Hill in the superhero spectacular ""The Avengers"" (2012), a movie that ruled the box office for the year and set the stage for numerous potential follow-up appearances by the in-demand actress. Blessed with undeniable beauty, only enhanced by her seemingly effortless grace and confidence, Smulders looked forward to a very bright future on screens both small and large."

His creative output led to a scholarship to attend New York University. After graduating, Watts joined Park Pictures, a production company making music videos, internet content, and short films. One of these was a trailer for ""Clown"" (2014), a horror film they claimed was directed by Eli Roth. Roth's popularity generated interest in the trailer, eventually from Roth himself, who contacted Watts and his friends and helped get the funding to make the film. Released four years after the initial trailer was made, the film was also written by Watts and his friend Christopher Ford. Watts and Ford again collaborated on the script for ""Cop Car"" (2015), with Watts directing Kevin Bacon as a bad cop who crosses paths with a couple of unfortunate kids. The film was roundly applauded by filmgoers and critics and brought him to the attention of executives at Marvel, who were looking for someone to bring a vision to the next iteration of ""Spider-Man."" Watts, again collaborating with Ford on the script, got the call and directed ""Spiderman: Homecoming"" (2017). The film was largely praised by critics and fans alike, who cheered the successful reimagining of a classic super hero. In 2017 it was announced that Watts would direct a sequel to the film."

Television brought him wider exposure as the star of two popular series: the long-running sitcom ""Coach"" (ABC, 1989-1997) followed by the gritty crime drama ""The District"" (CBS, 2000-04). Despite his busy schedule, Nelson continued to keep a hand in TV movies and theatrical features, most notably as the voice of the super-heroic Mr. Incredible in the acclaimed animated Pixar feature ""The Incredibles"" (2004). After many more supporting turns and guest appearances, fans welcomed the actor's return to a regular series role as Zeek Braverman, the even-keeled patriarch of a large, eclectic clan in the Ron Howard-produced dramedy series, ""Parenthood"" (NBC, 2010-15).

Born Sarah Jane Vowell in Muskogee, Oklahoma on December 27, 1969, she moved with her parents and twin sister, Amy, to Bozeman, Montana when she was eleven years of age. She earned her bachelor's degree in modern languages and literatures from Montana State University in 1993 before gaining her master's degree in art history from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1996. Vowell released her first book of essays, Radio On: A Listener's Diary, the following year, which caught the attention of Ira Glass, host of the Public Radio International program ""This American Life."" Vowell began contributing segments to the series, which in turn led to writing assignments for McSweeney's, Salon and the San Francisco Weekly. Vowell soon established herself as a unique observer of American life, with an particular emphasis on the more obscure elements of United States history, through books like Take the Cannoli (2000) and The Partly Cloudy Patriot (2002). In 2004, a segment on ""This American Life"" about her making and firing a homemade cannon attracted the producers of the Pixar animated feature ""The Incredibles,"" who tapped her to provide the voice of Violet Parr, the shy but resilient daughter of married superheroes. The following year, Vowell issued Assassination Vacation, her document of visits to locations across America where Presidents Lincoln, McKinley and Garfield were murdered, and began a sporadic tenure as guest columnist for The New York Times. The popularity of her books and radio essays led to regular appearances on talk shows like ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" (NBC, 1993-2009), as well as occasional acting appearances in features like ""Please Give"" (2010) and the HBO comedy ""Bored to Death"" (2009-2011). During this period, Vowell's literary career continued unabated, and soon encompassed The Wordy Shipmates (2008), about the Puritan's influence on America; Unfamiliar Fishes (2011), which concerned the idea of ""manifest destiny"" through the history of Hawaii's annexation by the United States; and Lafayette in the Somewhat United States (2015), about the Revolutionary War hero the Marquis of Lafayette."

A native of Chicago's suburbs and later product of the Second City comedy fraternity, he followed that talent pipeline to a writing job on NBC's weekend institution ""Saturday Night Live"" (1975- ). Finding the ""SNL"" environment suffocating, he landed a cast role on ""The Ben Stiller Show."" Though the show only lasted a season, it would put Odenkirk in with Hollywood's comedy in-crowd, netting him work on HBO's groundbreaking single-cam ""The Larry Sanders Show"" (1993-98), writing for fellow ""SNL""-alum Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, and eventually creating his own HBO series alongside former ""Stiller"" co-writer David Cross, ""Mr. Show."" (The pair reunited later for a second series, ""W/ Bob and David"" (Netflix 2015).) He would expand his rÃ©sumÃ© as a producer-talent spotter of underground, post-structural comedy for online media and Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, and as director of such offbeat, almost awkwardly silly comedy features as ""Let's Go to Prison"" (2006) and ""The Brothers Solomon"" (2008). Maintaining a regimen of comic supporting roles and TV guest-work, Odenkirk in 2009 joined the cast of the Emmy-winning AMC series ""Breaking Bad"" (2008-2013) as the cheerfully malignant TV lawyer Saul Goodman, a role he deepened and expanded on in the seriocomic prequel ""Better Call Saul"" (AMC 2015- ). A missionary of ironic over-the-top social satire, Odenkirk made himself a nexus of the edgiest comic circles."

Bird's professional story is often said to have begun when, at age 11, he met Walt Disney Studios animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson during a tour of the studio. Having earned the animators' interest, Bird managed to get their eyes on an original animated short film that he completed two years later. By the time he was 14, Bird had become the protÃ©gÃ©e of Disney animator Milt Kahl; when it came time for Bird to pursue higher education, Disney awarded him a scholarship to the California Institute of the Arts. Following graduation, he began working for Disney as an animator. His early projects included the short film ""The Small One"" (1978) and the feature film ""The Fox and the Hound"" (1981), during production of which Bird was fired for a contentious relationship with upper management. From there, he leapt directly to the world of television, all the while maintaining footing in the film world with projects like ""*batteries not included"" (1987), which he co-wrote. Bird worked on ""Amazing Stories"" (NBC 1985-87), helped to develop ""The Simpsons"" (Fox 1989-), and worked on ""The Critic"" (ABC/Fox 1994-95) and ""King of the Hill"" (Fox 1997-2010). Bird made his feature directorial debut with the critically beloved ""The Iron Giant"" (1999), which earned him a job at the blossoming animation company Pixar, ultimately landing him back beneath the Disney umbrella. With the company, Brad directed and produced the ""The Incredibles"" (2004), an adventure film about a family of superheroes, and ""Ratatouille"" (2007), a comedy about a rat who works with a French chef to create gourmet meals. Next, he'd move into the world of live-action directing, helming ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" (2011), the fourth film in the ""Mission: Impossible"" film franchise. His next live-action effort, ""Tomorrowland"" (2015), would prove a critical and commercial disappointment, and Bird would return to animation thereafter. He directed ""Incredibles 2"" (2018), which ranked among the highest grossing animated films of all time."

She made her debut opposite her mother in 1976's ""A Matter of Time,"" but did not land a significant role until David Lynch cast her in his groundbreaking ""Blue Velvet."" Her heartbreaking performance, simultaneously pitiable and alluring, led to similar roles in films like ""Death Becomes Her"" (1992), but she displayed a knack for comedy in ""The Imposters"" (1998) and grittier fare in ""Crime of the Century"" (HBO, 1996), among many others. An author, activist and the head of her own cosmetics label, she also enjoyed an intriguing side career as a filmmaker with ""My Dad is 100 Years Old"" (2006), which paid tribute to her father, and the short film series ""Green Porno"" (2008).

A veteran Tony Award-winning stage actor, Bostwick moved to the screen where he soon found lasting notoriety in the cult classic ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" (1975) opposite a then unknown Susan Sarandon. While many of his later efforts were far less memorable - the nostalgic ""Movie, Movie"" (1978) and ridiculous ""Megaforce"" (1982) being prime examples - Bostwick nevertheless remained a constant presence, primarily on the small screen. With his formal bearing and commanding voice, the actor was often cast as military and political leaders, notably in several Judith Krantz adaptations and two famously lengthy turns as George Washington, culminating in an award-winning role as Lieutenant Carter ""Lady"" Aster in the acclaimed miniseries, ""War and Remembrance"" (1988). Bostwick later brilliantly flexed his comedic muscle as the hilariously incompetent New York City mayor on the long-running sitcom ""Spin City"" (ABC, 1996-2002) opposite Michael J. Fox. After the series ended, he remained a familiar face on television with frequent guest spots on popular series like ""Law & Order"" Special Victims Unit"" (NBC, 1999- ).

But instead of taking that next step, Banks continued to struggle in a long stretch of guest appearances without a regular series role, while also being lost in the background in a number of films like ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" (1995) and ""Dark Blue"" (2003). He did make himself known on the second season of ""Dexter"" (Showtime, 2006-2013) as an FBI agent in pursuit of the Bay Harbor Butcher, but even then he was unable to find that one breakout role that propelled his career. That all changed when he was cast as Mike Ehrmantraut, a former cop-turned-drug fixer on the award-winning series ""Breaking Bad"" (AMC, 2008-2013) and its prequel ""Better Call Saul"" (AMC 2015- ).

Undeniably talented and unswervingly determined, she signed her first recording contract at the age of 13. After her first two albums performed poorly outside her native Colombia, Shakira took a firmer hand in the production and direction of subsequent efforts, infusing her music with a rock sensibility and the Arabic rhythms that had influenced her in her youth. It was a bold decision that paid off handsomely with the release and chart-topping domination of hit singles like ""Ojos AsÃ­"" and ""Hips Don't Lie."" While the former song would earn Shakira a Latin Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, the latter broke a record for the most airplay during a single week in the history of American radio. By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the entertainer was one of the top-earning women in music and a featured performer at the inauguration of President Barack Obama. As a singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, philanthropist and even judge on ""The Voice"" (NBC, 2011- ), Shakira consistently exceeded expectations in a career that endeared her to legions of fans from every corner of the globe."

A native of Canada, Chong emerged from that country's rock music scene, but found success on the comedy circuit with the Los Angeles-born Marin; their comedy team played up the absurdity of mainstream America's reaction to the drug culture of the 1970s, as well as the loopy logic that was part of the marijuana lifestyle. The success of their comedy albums led to a film career beginning with 1978's ""Up in Smoke,"" but by the mid-80s, their act had run out of gas, leading to the duo's breakup in 1985. While Cheech Marin enjoyed success in film and on television, Chong floundered in the decades that followed, with a 2003 conviction for selling drug paraphernalia a particular low point. However, his 2008 reunion with Marin as the beloved Cheech and Chong proved that their decades-old material still held a fresh buzz for veteran fans and newcomers alike."

She nabbed a non-speaking role in Woody Allen's 1977 comedy ""Annie Hall,"" and followed that up with a role in the 1978 drama ""Madman."" Weaver's breakout role, however, came in 1979 when she played the lead character of Ripley in director Ridley Scott's classic science-fiction horror film ""Alien."" The huge success of ""Alien"" spawned numerous sequels, including ""Aliens"" (1986), ""Alien 3"" (1992), and ""Alien: Resurrection"" (1997), all of three which Weaver reprised her role as Ripley. In addition to her starring role in the ""Alien"" franchise, in the 1980s Weaver found success in films ""Ghostbusters,"" ""Working Girl"" (1988), and ""Gorillas in the Mist,"" the latter two of which would earn her Oscar nominations. Weaver continued working steadily throughout the 90s and 2000s, with notable roles in ""Dave"" (1993), ""The Ice Storm"" (1997), and director James Cameron's Oscar-winning science-fiction epic ""Avatar."" By the 2010s Weaver began appearing on television. She appeared in two mini-series"" ""Political Animals"" (USA, 2012) and ""The Defenders"" (Netflix, 2017). While heading into her sixth decade as a professional actress, Weaver showed no signs of slowing down. She reprised her role as Dr. Grace Augustine in the ""Avatar"" franchise. ""Avatar 2"" was released in 2020, the first of four sequels in the franchise."

He emerged from the London drama stage to film stardom in the late 1970s with a pair of powerhouse performances in ""Midnight Express"" (1978) and ""Alien"" (1979) - roles that established Hurt's strength for playing mental and physical suffering. In addition to his other renowned characters of torment - most famously, ""The Elephant Man"" (1980) - Hurt's palette grew to include the oppressed Winston Smith in ""1984"" (1984) and numerous baleful deadbeats, such as in ""Night Train"" (1998). He also displayed a penchant for playing morally compromised nobleman, as portrayed in ""Rob Roy"" (1995) and ""V for Vendetta"" (2006). As he aged, Hurt added an increasing number of academics and authors to his rÃ©sumÃ©, including roles in ""Love and Death on Long Island"" (1997) and ""Hellboy"" (2004). Despite the character actor's naturalistic portraits, there was no denying Hurt also had an eye for the commercial as well, co-starring in ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" (2008) and ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (2008). Whether he starred in a high-profile audience pleaser or a critically acclaimed dramatic film, Hurt always brought his talents to the fore.

During that decade, Cartwright toiled in guest appearances and smaller roles while her younger sister Angela earned her place as a trivia question by playing Danny Thomas' daughter on ""Make Room For Daddy."" Veronica landed good feature roles, however, ranging from her debut in ""In Love and War"" (1958) to the kleptomaniac forced to lie about her teachers in William Wyler's ""The Children's Hour"" (1961). In 1963, she was also the daughter of the family terrorized by Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and Henry Fonda's child in ""Spencer's Mountain."" Although her sister had become the TV regular, from 1959, Cartwright had the recurring role of the bullying Violet Rutherford (who gave Theodore his first kiss) on ABC's ""Leave It to Beaver"" and she spent two seasons (1964-66) as the frontiersman's daughter Jemima, on the NBC series ""Daniel Boone."""

Emmet Walsh in a supporting role can be altogether bad."" Of course, there were a few misfires along the way, but most were redeemed by the actor's strength for playing haggard men with battered souls. Stanton was well-liked and utilized by some of modern cinema's most visionary directors including Sam Peckinpah, David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, Sean Penn and Wim Wenders. It was Wenders who launched Stanton's late career breakout when he cast him in an acclaimed leading role in ""Paris, Texas"" (1984), but prior to that quietly haunting performance, Stanton spent 25 years playing hard-bitten outlaws in notable films like ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), ""Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid"" (1973) and ""The Rose"" (1979). Stanton was transformed into a wizened cult figure of the American indie film scene with ""Repo Man"" (1984), ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988), and ""She's So Lovely"" (1996) - to say nothing of his fatherly turn in ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986) and his unforgettable role as one of the doomed Nostromo crew of ""Alien"" (1979). A restless, unconventional spirit off-camera, Stanton always lent a sympathetic realness to the menacing criminals and barroom-dwelling outsiders he stashed beneath his craggy face and wiry, worn frame. Late career work like his complex role as the head of a disgraced religious sect in ""Big Love"" (HBO 2006-2011) and as kindhearted trailer park manager Carl Rodd on ""Twin Peaks: The Return"" (Showtime 2017) traded on the decades etched in Stanton's unforgettable face. Harry Dean Stanton's death at the age of 91 on September 15, 2017 was mourned by friends, fans and fellow film and television professionals around the world."

Trained on the stages of London, the talented thespian was initially seen in relatively minor roles in such films as ""The Bofors Gun"" (1968) and ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" (1971). The reprisal of his Tony-winning role in the film adaptation of Harold Pinter's ""The Homecoming"" (1973) boosted Holm's reputation among his peers, but did little to increase his modest exposure. His career in film reached an entirely new level, however, after he stunned audiences as a murderous android in the sci-fi horror classic ""Alien"" (1979), before endearing himself as a nurturing coach in ""Chariots of Fire"" (1981). An amazing array of performances followed in such efforts as ""Time Bandits"" (1981), ""Brazil"" (1985), ""Naked Lunch"" (1991), ""Big Night"" (1996) and ""The Sweet Hereafter"" (1997), all of which were recognized when Holm was knighted by the Queen of England in 1998 for his services in drama. Nearly 40 years into his film career and still going strong, the actor delivered one of his more beloved portrayals as the hobbit Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001). Whether playing a tortured soul, a caring patriarch or an eccentric madman, Holm inhabited each character with an ease that audiences, critics and his fellow actors could only marvel at."

He emerged from the New York stage in the early 1960s, working steadily in small but significant roles in features like ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1967) before moving up to supporting roles and leads in ""Across 110th Street"" (1971). His star-making turn came as the villainous Dr. Kananga in ""Live and Let Die"" (1973), which marked Roger Moore's debut as James Bond and preceded a long run as a popular character actor in such major features as ""Alien"" (1979) and ""Brubaker"" (1980). Kotto was stranded in minor-league acting features for much of the 1980s, though he rebounded in the early 1990s as the formidable Lt. Al Giardello on the critically acclaimed ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" (NBC, 1993-2000). Throughout his long and varied career, Kotto's performances were marked by an unerring sense of gravity, honesty and intelligence, which served him well in avoiding many of the career pitfalls suffered by African-American actors."

Emerging from the world of television commercial production, Scott was nearly 40 years old by the time he helmed his first feature ""The Duellists"" (1977). Its lackluster reception left audiences ill-prepared for the massive impact that came next with the classic science-fiction/horror film ""Alien"" (1979). Although a commercial disaster at the time, ""Blade Runner"" (1982) would later be regarded as one of the most influential sci-fi movies ever made, while Scott's on-set behavior during production earned him a lasting reputation as an exceptionally stubborn and difficult director. The years that followed were marked by the ebb and flow of disappointment and triumph, as illustrated by efforts like ""Legend"" (1985), ""Thelma & Louise"" (1991), ""White Squall"" (1996) and ""Gladiator"" (2000). Remarkably, Scott moved into the next millennium with an even steadier output of work that included such highlights as ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005), ""American Gangster"" (2007), the ""Alien"" prequel-of-sorts ""Prometheus"" (2012) and the Academy Award-nominated science fiction comedy-thriller ""The Martian"" (2015).

With the minuscule budget of $60,000, Carpenter expanded the project into a feature--now considered a minor genre classic--in 1974. O'Bannon was along, serving in a number of capacities, including scripting, editing and even playing one of the leading roles. This witty but bleak alternative to high quality films (i.e., Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"") was described by its creators as ""'Waiting for Godot' in outer space."" Mishandled in its initial distribution, ""Dark Star"" garnered cult status as a popular fixture on the college circuit in the late 70s."

With ""Alien,"" directed by Ridley Scott, Shusett worked collaboratively with writer Dan O'Bannon, though Shusett came up with the concept for one of the most memorable and iconic scenes, in which an alien bursts through John Hurt's stomach. Though there were several sequels and crossovers, Shusett was only directly involved with ""Alien vs. Predator""--a crossover idea that actually originated from a comic book, though Shusett wrote the original story for the script. O'Bannon and Shusett collaborated on the script and production on ""Total Recall,"" an action sci-fi film directed by sci-fi auteur Paul Verhoeven that was critically very well-received and financially successful. Shusett wrote a sequel to this film, but it became so drastically modified by outside parties that it eventually became the neo-noir sci-fi film ""Minority Report,"" directed by Steven Spielberg. Though almost none of Shusett's original ideas were left in the film, he acted as executive producer. In a fairly rare departure from more action-based films, Shusett and O'Bannon also wrote the screenplay for the horror sci-fi film ""Bleeders,"" based on an H.P. Lovecraft novel about a monstrous and grotesque inbreeding family."

By 1974, he took his expertise in the action genre to the big screen, turning in a tightly-wound screenplay for ""The Parallax View,"" a political thriller starring Warren Beatty. Giler went on to write the well-received comedies ""The Black Bird"" (1975) and ""Fun with Dick and Jane"" (1977) before tackling his most fondly remembered project, the 1979 sci-fi horror classic ""Alien."" Initially brought in to produce the film, Giler and co-producer Walter Hill assisted in an extensive rewrite of the original Dan O'Brannon-authored script, resulting in a much-publicized battle over the ultimate screenplay credit. The controversy failed to inhibit Giler's involvement in the ""Alien"" franchise, with his growing list of producer credits in coming decades including multiple sequels to the original film, as well as a contentious rewrite of the third movie in the series, ""Alien 3"" (1992).

A one-time student of acclaimed composer MiklÃ³s RÃ³zsa, Goldsmith channeled his passion for classical composition into his work on such prestige pictures as ""Lonely Are the Brave"" (1962), ""Lilies of the Field"" (1963), and ""Patton"" (1970), the latter of which garnered him one of many Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score. During his journeyman years as an in-house composer for the Columbia Broadcasting System, Goldsmith was an indispensable component of such long-running television series as ""Playhouse 90,"" ""Dr. Kildare,"" ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" but his stock in the film industry rose via his associations with such A-list directors as John Huston, Otto Preminger, John Sturges, and Franklin J. Schaffner. In the bell lap of his long and distinguished career, Goldsmith became the composer of choice for such new talents as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven, Joe Dante and Curtis Hanson, while his scoring for the revived ""Star Trek"" franchise won him a new generation of followers. Cut down by cancer in 2004, Goldsmith had long since attained enshrinement as a top-flight Hollywood composer, able to bridge the distant past and the unforeseeable future with an infectious measure of wonder and optimism."

Strongly influenced by John Ford and Howard Hawks - he once claimed every film he had ever made was a Western - he allowed action to define character, believing ""there is nothing more absurd than properly motivated characters,"" and concentrated on creating stunning visual spectacle through experiments in lighting, montage, composition and camera angles. For Hill, violence in varying degrees of stylization provided the stamp of macho gesture; women were extensions of the male world, exhibiting testosterone toughness and masculine meanness; and ""home"" illuminated a path for those who had lost their way.

An iconic figure in cult film circles, Wray eventually turned her back on performing to enjoy frequent public appearances as herself. Living well into her nineties, Wray turned down the offer to contribute a cameo appearance to director Peter Jackson's 2005 remake of ""King Kong"" shortly before her death from natural causes in late 2004.

That approach to the role was not relegated only to Capra's film; many of Travers's performances are similar in tone, though serious drama was not outside of his reach. Some of his finest acting can be seen in the William Wyler drama ""Mrs. Miniver,"" playing the postman Mr. Ballard, for which he received his only Oscar nomination.

Despite competition from a brilliant cast headed by Bette Davis, Herbert Marshall and Teresa Wright, Collinge etched an unforgettable portrait of the genteel, hapless, emotionally abused member of the predatory Giddens family. Indeed, she almost stole the film in her most memorable scene, in which Birdie admits that her headaches are faked and her alcoholism an escape from her intense loathing of her own husband and son."

Tiomkin then moved into Western territory for a number of Fred Zinnemann films including ""High Noon"" (1952), whose box-office success was widely attributed to a hit theme tune which unarguably introduced the concept of the blockbuster soundtrack. Showcasing his versatility, Tiomkin also scored four Alfred Hitchcock classics, changed the course of science fiction music on Howard Hawks' ""The Thing"" (1951) and enhanced the epic nature of ""The Land of the Pharaohs"" (1955). Tiomkin's 'golden decade' ended in 1958 but he continued to court awards attention with his expansive scores for ""Town Without Pity"" (1961), ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) and his final work, ""Chaikovsky"" (1969), and also made a major impact on the small screen with his memorable theme to ""Rawhide"" (CBS, 1959-1965).

Born to Italian and Algerian parents in Palermo, Italy in 1971, Guadagnino spent six years in Ethiopia until returning to his family to Italy. He studied film history and criticism at the Sapienza University of Rome, and worked briefly as a critic before trying his hand at directing. Guadagnino began producing and directing short films in the late '90s, earning critical praise for the experimental feature ""The Protagonists"" (1999), with Tilda Swinton as a film director who travels with her Italian crew to London to investigate a murder case. Swinton would collaborate with Guadagnino on several subsequent projects, including the documentary interview ""Tilda Swinton: The Love Factory"" (2002) and the Oscar-nominated ""I Am Love"" (2009), with the British actress as the unfaithful wife of an Italian textile manufacturer (Flavio Parenti). In addition to these efforts, he also helmed numerous documentaries (""Mundo civilizado,"" (2003) and features like the Italian box office hit ""Melissa P."" (2005), about a teenaged girl's sexual misadventures. He also directed numerous short films and promotional material for fashion lines like Fendi and Ferragamo, produced short films for other filmmakers, like the award-winning ""Diarchy"" (2010) for director Ferdinando Cito Filomarino, and even directed a production of the opera ""Falstaff"" for the Teatro Filarmonico in Verona, Italy in 2011. Feature films, however, remained his most impressive showcase, as evidenced by the critical acclaim for his 2015 film ""A Bigger Splash,"" which refashioned the 1969 French drama ""La Piscine"" as an erotic psychological drama with Swinton as a rock star whose vacation on a remote Italian island is interrupted by the arrival of her former lover (Ralph Fiennes) and his daughter (Dakota Johnson). ""Bigger Splash"" was nominated for a Golden Lion and won two awards at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, including Best Innovative Budget Award, and led to a slew of future film projects. One of these was his commercial breakthrough film, the romance ""Call Me By Your Name"" (2017), which garnered strong reviews and made an overnight star of its leading man, Timothee Chalamet.

Prior to that time, the handsome, boyish actor had earned critical praise for his work in ""Friendly Persuasion"" (1956) and ""Fear Strikes Out"" (1957), and was regarded as a fine candidate for romantic lead parts. However, that quickly changed after he portrayed murderous mama's boy Norman Bates in Hitchcock's hugely successful thriller, ""Psycho"" (1960). Perkins was so effective that for many viewers and producers, the role came to define him. A sojourn in Europe helped Perkins earn other sorts of assignments. He also gave a wonderful return performance as Norman in ""Psycho II"" (1983), and that unexpectedly effective film helped to revive public interest in him. A masterful character actor, Perkins' ability to convey mental instability in a fashion that was simultaneously disturbing, affecting, and darkly humorous made him a unique and valuable talent."

But in 1960, Leigh's name - and terrifying screams - became synonymous with cinematic legend as Alfred Hitchcock's doomed heroine in the infamous stabbing shower scene from ""Psycho."" Despite her later roles, which were eventually superseded by turns as a mother, humanitarian and best-selling author, audiences would still forever remember those fateful 45 seconds of the dying Leigh, glimpsed in silhouette, her hands tearing vainly at the shower curtain as her blood spirals down the drain.

An attractive, composed woman who worked as a model after placing third in the 1948 Miss America contest, she broke into films in 1951. Although her first leads were in modest films, her earnest, outdoorsy heroines suited her well for ""The Rose Bowl Story"" (1952) and Jacques Tourneur's stylish ""Wichita"" (1955). She also kept busy in TV anthologies, where she first worked with the directors who helmed her most important films. John Ford directed Miles in ""Rookie of the Year"" (1955), an episode of ""Screen Directors Playhouse"" which led him to cast her as an outspoken frontierswoman in his classic ""The Searchers"" (1956).

He was soon cast in the lead in Douglas Sirk's melodrama ""A Time to Love and a Time to Die"" and his masterpiece ""Imitation of Life."" These were followed up by Gavin's roles in ""Psycho"" and ""Spartacus."" Afterwards, his screen career seemed to stall, and he moved to television with the title role on the Western lawman series ""Destry"" and the part of Commander Dan Talbot on the World War II series ""Convoy."" After a role in the screen version of the musical ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" and a part as the lead spy in the French James Bond-style spy flick ""OSS 117 - Double Agent,"" Gavin saw his career slowly burn out, with occasional TV work throughout the 1970s.

2097,Robert Bloch,4/5/1917,"Chicago, Illinois, USA",/assets/pizza-pie/images/poster_default.c8c896e70c3.gif,"Though author Robert Bloch's career was frequently encapsulated by his most famous work - the 1959 novel Psycho, which served as the basis for Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film of the same name - he produced a vast and celebrated body of work, including numerous books, short stories, screenplays and teleplays over the course of a six-decade career that minted him as one of the masters of horror fiction. He began publishing stories in his teens, emulating the eldritch fantasies of his mentor, H.P. Lovecraft. But in the 1940s, Bloch wrote a series of novels in which the terror was generated by all-too-human sources, beginning with the fetish thriller The Scarf (1947) and culminating in Psycho, a novel of lethal split personalities based on the real-life crimes of Ed Gein, later the inspiration for ""The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre"" (1974). Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" allowed him to work steadily in television and features, writing for ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" (CBS, 1955-1960; 1962-64; NBC, 1960-62; 1964-65) and ""Star Trek"" (NBC, 1966-69), among other series, while continuing to turn out novels and short stories at a prolific rate. He returned to Psycho for two sequels, Psycho II (1982) and Psycho House (1990), which were unrelated to the Hitchcock film and continued to write until his death in 1994. Bloch's vision of psychological terror lurking within the faÃ§ade of everyday life, as well as his substantive body of work, had a profound influence on the horror genre, of which he was one of its most respected practitioners."

He began his career in West End dramas and on the big screen in period, often literary adaptations, before a number of successful romantic comedies including ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" (2001) and broader historic dramas like ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"" (2003) turned him into ""the thinking woman's heartthrob."" While the moniker stuck throughout his career, Firth continued to showcase untapped facets of his talent in independent films, family-friendly hits, and gutsy cable movies. With noted turns in ""Love, Actually"" (2003), ""Nanny McPhee"" (2006) and ""Mamma Mia!"" (2008), Firth displayed both serious acting chops and an easygoing screen presence that continually pleased audiences. But the actor took his career to a new level with ""A Single Man"" (2009) and ""The King's Speech"" (2010). The roles were tour-de-force performances that earned Firth several award nominations and wins and elevated his career to new heights. Colin Firth was born on Sept. 10, 1960, the son of academic lecturers who raised their young family in Nigeria for four years before settling in England. Firth seemed unlikely to follow in his family's footsteps and by his early teens, had developed a keen interest in acting, partially inspired by British great Paul Scofield and his performance in ""A Man for All Seasons"" (1966). Firth began dramatic studies with the National Youth Theatre at 18 and went on to make a significant impression at The Drama Centre London. Fresh out of that program, Firth was surprised to find himself cast as the lead in a West End production of Julian Mitchell's ""Another Country,"" replacing Daniel Day-Lewis in the role of upper class spy-in-the-making, Guy Bennett. Over the next decade, Firth enjoyed a steady if low-profile living as an actor, making his screen debut in the 1984 film version of ""Another Country"" and sticking close to his stage roots in George Bernard Shaw's ""The Doctor's Dilemma"" and ""The Lonely Road,"" a psychological family drama that earned Firth critical notice. Dipping his t in romantic lead territory, he co-starred opposite Greta Scacchi in a small screen remake of George Cukor's ""Camille"" (CBS, 1984), and anchored the 1986 British miniseries ""Lost Empires,"" playing a touring entertainer in early 20th century England. He solidified his standing as an actor of substance and heady range with a return to the London stage in Eugene O'Neill's ""Desire Under the Elms."" Firth showcased his darker side in ""A Month in the Country""(1987), where he essayed a haunted World War I veteran who romances a vicar's wife, and ""Apartment Zero"" (1988), a rare contemporary role where he made an impression as a lonely and sheltered film lover whose life is changed when he takes in a mysterious American boarder. In 1989, he earned his first acting awards, including one from the Royal Television Society, for his portrayal of paralyzed soldier Robert Lawrence in the TV biopic, ""Tumbledown."" Later in the year Milos Forman's ""Valmont"" (1989) marked Firth's entry into the American studio film world, and he was both appealing and appalling as the rich and too clever 18th century count in the adaptation of the classic French novel Les Liasons Dangereuses. Unfortunately, the film was overshadowed by the previous year's lavish take on the same material, ""Dangerous Liaisons"" (1988). Following appearances in a number of European-produced films that were little-seen across the pond, as well as London stage runs in a pair of comedies, Firth truly made his international breakthrough in 1995. The Dublin University-set romance ""Circle of Friends"" (1995) was moderately popular, but the BBC production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1995) was wildly popular in Britain and exported to the U.S. (A&E, 1996). Suddenly, Firth found himself dubbed a ""heartthrob"" for his take on the aloof, arrogant, but ultimately redeemable 18th century suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy in the adaptation of what was considered literary history's first romantic comedy. He was recognized by the BAFTA and National Television awards with a Best Actor nomination. The following year, Firth offered a stoic turn as the cuckold husband of Kristin Scott Thomas' in ""The English Patient"" (1996), the Oscar winner of Best Picture of the Year among other countless accolades. Firth's starring role in Nick Hornby's football-themed story ""Fever Pitch"" (1997) was little seen in the States, but ""Shakespeare in Love"" (1998) was a certified blockbuster that swept the Oscars and BAFTAs. In the fictionalized fable of the Bard's off-book romance, Firth cut a dashing figure in doublet and hose in the comic, slightly villainous role of the Earl of Wessex. He excelled as an eccentric inventor in the 1930s-set ""My Life So Far"" (1999) before taking on a bit of post-modern casting by playing Mark Darcy - a character inspired by his glowering interpretation of the Austen hero - in the film version of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001). His performance in the hugely successful chick flick fueled Firth's growing cult of female admirers, earned the actor a BAFTA nomination, and also shifted the tide towards more contemporary and romantic comedy roles. An Emmy-nominated performance as a Nazi secretary of state in HBO's ""Conspiracy"" (2001) and a remake of ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (2002) maintained Firth's close ties with headier, more literary material, while a 2003 appearance as Amanda Bynes' unknowing English father in the light-as-feather teen comedy ""What a Girl Wants"" (2003) and a role in the romantic ensemble ""Love Actually"" (2003) proved that the popular actor had mainstream crossover appeal. He returned to period dramas but cemented his romantic lead status with his portrayal of 17th Century artist Johannes Vermeer in ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" (2003) - a tale that projected an intimate relationship between the famed painter and the young subject (Scarlett Johansson) of his most renowned work of art. Firth reprised Mark Darcy for the sequel blockbuster ""Bridget Jones and the Edge of Reason"" (2004), which found his character in a series of ups and downs and misunderstandings with neurotic Jones, despite finally having become her official boyfriend. The solid mid-forties actor entered the family film fray in 2005 as a harried widower with seven unruly kids in the critically-lauded fable ""Nanny McPhee."" In a pair of very different family tales, Firth starred as an author coming to terms with the troubled relationship with his dying father in the limited release ""When Did You Last See Your Father?"" (2007), and played a single father and ill-chosen love interest of Helen Hunt in ""Then She Found Me"" (2007). Firth carried on in the romantic comedy vein, co-starring alongside Uma Thurman in the critically reviled ""The Accidental Husband"" (2007) and in the big screen adaptation of the Abba-inspired stage musical ""Mamma Mia"" (2008), as one of Meryl Streep's character's former lovers and the possible father of her daughter. In a rare appearance in a dark thriller, Firth also starred in ""Genova"" (2008), playing a widowed father who attempts to make a fresh start with his young daughters in Italy, only to find the past coming back to haunt him. Following a starring turn in the British remake ""St. Trinian's"" (2009) and a co-starring role in the romantic comedy ""Easy Virtue"" (2009), Firth played Fred, the nephew and only living relative to Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey), in Disney's take on the Charles Dickens classic, ""A Christmas Carol"" (2009). Firth turned to more challenging dramatic fare when he starred in ""A Single Man"" (2009), playing a gay British college professor in 1962 who struggles to find meaning in his life after the death of his long-time partner (Matthew Goode). Working for first-time feature director, fashion designer Tom Ford on ""The Single Man,"" Firth gave a conflicted, layered performance which garnered the actor several award nominations at year's end, including nods from the Independent Spirit, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and Academy for Best Actor. He next delivered another exemplary dramatic performance in ""The King's Speech"" (2010), playing King George VI, who struggles to overcome a debilitating speech impediment during a time of national crisis. The king enlists the help of unorthodox speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a relationship that begins discordantly, only to grow into an unbreakable bond. ""The King's Speech"" received widespread critical acclaim and found its way onto many year-end Top Ten lists. While the film had exceptional supporting performances from Rush and Helena Bonham Carter, it was Firth who earned the most adulation, including Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG wins for Best Actor. Firth followed that with an acclaimed performance in an adaptation of John le Carre's spy novel ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" (2011) and a remake of the thriller ""Gambit"" (2012) with a script by Joel and Ethan Coen. Starring rolesin the comedy-drama ""ArthurNewman"" (2013), war film ""The Railway Man"" (2014), crime drama ""Devil's Knot"" (2014), Woody Allen-directed romantic comedy ""Magic in the Moonlight"" (2014), psychological thriller ""Before I Go To Sleep"" (2014) and action blockbuster ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" (2015). After starring as literary editor Maxwell Perkinsin ""Genius"" (2016), Firth returned to one of his best-loved roles in ""Bridget Jones's Baby"" (2016) and co-starred in another sequel,""Kingsman: The Golden Circle"" (2017). Firth next starred in Rupert Everett's ""The Happy Prince"" (2018), musical comedy sequel ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"" (2018) and the much-anticipated ""Mary Poppins Returns"" (2018). His sole release the following year was a starring role in Sam Mendes'war drama ""1917"" (2019)."

Working with directors as formidable as Kenneth Branagh, Robert Altman, Stephen Fry, Mike Leigh, and Tom Hooper, Scarborough became a virtual fixture of British film and television. Adrian Philip Scarborough was born on May 10, 1968 in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England. He turned early to acting, studying the trade at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, at which he was honored among his classmates with the Chesterton Award for Best Actor. Following graduation, Scarborough toggled between roles in film and television, incepting his big screen career with a part in the historical biopic ""The Madness of King George"" (1994), and his small screen career with roles on the crime drama program ""The Governor"" (ITV 1995-96) and the animated children's series ""The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends"" (BBC 1992-95). Scarborough's film roles from then on ranged in scope and theme, coming to form as comedies like Kenneth Branagh's ""A Midwinter's Tale"" (1995) and ""The Revengers' Comedies"" (1998), and dramas like Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"" (2001), Stephen Frears' ""Dirty Pretty Things"" (2002), and Mike Leigh's ""Vera Drake"" (2004). As the years went on, Scarborough began to find more and more recurring television roles, beginning with the novel series adaptation ""Cranford"" (BBC One 2007), the sitcom ""Gavin & Stacey"" (BBC Three 2007-08 / BBC One 2009-2010), and the horror comedy series ""Psychoville"" (BBC Two 2009-2011). No stranger to working with well respected directors, Scarborough nabbed two roles under the direction of the renowned Tom Hooper, appearing first in the Best Picture Academy Award-winning film ""The King's Speech"" (2010) and then in the Best Picture Academy Award-nominated musical drama ""Les MisÃ©rables"" (2012). Scarborough remained busy as ever thereafter, appearing in comedy films like ""Delicious"" (2013) and ""A Little Chaos"" (2014), as well as television series like ""Plebs"" (ITV2 2013-) and ""Up to the Women"" (BBC Four 2013-15)."

Born in Middlesbrough in 1979, Parker went on to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where he graduated in 2002. By 2004, he was appearing in ""History Boys"" on the West End. He went on to play the role for the Broadway, Sydney, Wellington, Hong Kong, film, and radio versions of the play. Still more prestigious stage work would follow for Parker, including a turn as Hippolito in a West End revival of ""The Revenger's Tragedy,"" as well as several productions at Shakespeare's Globe, such as ""As You Like It"" and ""Henry VI Part 1"" and ""Henry VI Part 2,"" the latter of which gave Parker a chance to show off his musical skills, when he played the recorder in a tavern scene. He would find an even bigger audience for his musicianship in 2015, when he performed several of Frank Sinatra's songs for the ""BBC Prom"" (BBC, 2015-) staging ""Prom 30: The John Wilson Orchestra Performs Frank Sinatra."" Parker's name would attract still more attention later that same year, when he took on the title role in the hotly anticipated stage play ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child."""

Previous to his Oscar triumph, Mendes enjoyed a long and very successful career in theater, directing acclaimed and visually stunning productions of William Shakespeare's ""The Tempest,"" Tennessee Williams' ""The Glass Menagerie,"" and Lionel Bart's popular musical ""Oliver!"" But it was his 1998 revival of ""Cabaret"" that attracted the attention of Hollywood - specifically Mendes fan Steven Spielberg, which led to the stage veteran directing his first feature. Following a few aborted film efforts and a triumphant return to theatre, Mendes returned to celluloid with the elaborate, lavish ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), which displayed some of the promise of his sterling debut, but ultimately failed to warm many hearts. Nonetheless, he maintained a steady output on stage and on screen, directing the Iraq War drama ""Jarhead"" (2005) and '50s period piece ""Revolutionary Road"" (2008), which starred his then-wife, Kate Winslet. Mendes took a huge commercial leap forward as the director of the 23rd and 24th James Bond films, ""Skyfall"" (2012) and ""Spectre"" (2015), which brought new emotional depth to the long-running series while confirming his status as an intelligent and deliberate filmmaker capable of crafting deeply resonant films."

Ever since his Oscar-nominated camerawork on ""Barton Fink"" (1991), Deakins filmed some of the most remarkable images recorded on celluloid. Whether conveying the sweeping grandeur of hope taking flight from prison walls in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), capturing the isolated, brittle snowscape of ""Fargo"" (1996), or putting on display the vibrant spirituality of Tibet in ""Kundun"" (1997), Deakins created a visual style visual style that turned him into a cinematographer sought after by the top directors in the business, while also earning a slew of Academy Award nominations. His work was awarded numerous times, mostly for his stunning camerawork on Coen Brothers films such as ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" (2001), ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007), ""True Grit"" (2010) and ""Hail, Caesar!"" (2016). He did, of course, branch out beyond the Coen Brothers universe where he earned further acclaim, most notably with ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), ""House of Sand and Fog"" (2003), ""In the Valley of Elah"" (2007), ""The Reader"" (2008), ""Skyfall"" (2012).

While early compositions for such 1980s offerings as ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" (1985) and ""The Lost Boys"" (1987) relied heavily on electronics, Newman's later efforts on projects like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) embraced a more traditional, orchestral sound. Work with frequent collaborator, director Sam Mendes, on the dysfunctional family drama ""American Beauty"" (1999) earned him widespread critical praise. Though he dealt primarily with film, Newman often intermixed feature work like the score to director Steven Soderbergh's ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000) with crafting music for such highly regarded television programs as ""Six Feet Under"" (HBO, 2001-05). Other highlights of an already admirable career included the compositions for Mendes' gangster drama ""Road to Perdition"" (2002) and two of Pixar's most beloved animated features, ""Finding Nemo"" (2004) and ""WALL-E"" (2008). Another partnership with Mendes on the 23rd James Bond film ""Skyfall"" (2012) once again garnered the composer industry-wide accolades for his stirring score.

Performing in stage productions of ""Ghosts,"" ""Long Day's Journey into Night"" and ""Hurlyburly"" helped pave the way for a feature film career atop the A-list, though his real on-camera start came with his deliciously eccentric performance as a heroin-addicted millionaire on the cult television series, ""Wiseguy"" (CBS, 1987-1990). After making the segue into features, Spacey bounced around in supporting roles until he gained widespread recognition for ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" (1992), in which he managed to keep up with heavyweights Al Pacino, Alec Baldwin and his personal idol, Jack Lemmon. But it was his Academy Award-winning performance as the mysterious Verbal Kint in ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995) that propelled Spacey into the limelight. He made equally impressionable appearances in ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997) and ""Se7en"" (1997), cementing his status as a hypnotic performer willing to challenge himself by playing unique characters. Though he slipped a bit with ""Pay It Forward"" (2000) and ""K-PAX"" (2001), Spacey remained a vital force in films like ""Superman Returns"" (2006), while also assuming the role of artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London in 2003.

In October 2017, an accusation by actor Anthony Rapp that Spacey had made sexual advances toward him when he was 14 caused Netflix to stop production on the final season of ""House of Cards"" during the era of show business self-examination brought on by the Harvey Weinstein scandal. As the allegations against Spacey grew in number, an unsettling portrait of the actor began to emerge, leading not only to his publicist and agents severing ties with him, but to the seemingly unprecedented step of director Ridley Scott removing Spacey from the completed J. Paul Getty biopic ""All the Money in the World"" (2017), re-filming his scenes with actor Christopher Plummer only weeks before the film was due to be released."

Cromwell began hitting his stride as a character actor in supporting roles in the 1980s, making his way in numerous made-for-television movies and miniseries, while earning some dubious acclaim as the nerdy father of an Ã¼ber-geek in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" (1984).

But it was his portrayal of a murderous Machiavellian police captain in ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997) that made audiences aware of his diverse talents, which paved the way to more prominent roles in large-scale films like ""The Green Mile"" (1999), ""The Sum of All Fears"" (2002), ""The Queen"" (2006) and ""W"" (2008). He also landed high-profile television roles, most notably on ""Six Feet Under"" (HBO, 2001-05), which granted the ever-busy Cromwell the recognition he richly deserved."

Following his debut in Sayles' ""The Return of the Secaucus Seven"" (1980), Strathairn branched out to more mainstream fare with a supporting role in ""Silkwood"" (1983) and delivered one of his finer performances in ""Eight Men Out"" (1988), in which he played the morally flawed pitcher Eddie Cicotte from the famed Black Sox. After another acclaimed Sayles performance - this time as the off-kilter street wretch, Asteroid, in ""City of Hope"" (1991) - Strathairn began to stretch his wings with supporting roles in major studio productions: He was Tom Cruise's jailbird brother in ""The Firm"" (1993), Meryl Streep's workaholic husband in ""The River Wild"" (1994) and the upscale purveyor of prostitution, Pierce Pratchett, in ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997). He also delivered strong turns on the small screen, as he did portraying the emotionally distant father of a son with AIDS in ""In the Gloaming"" (HBO, 1997) and Helen Keller's father in the remake of ""The Miracle Worker"" (ABC, 2000). But it was his performance as the iconic news anchor Edward R. Murrow, who openly challenged Senator Joseph McCarthy during the height of the Red Scare, in George Clooney's excellent period drama ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" (2005), as well as his portrayal of ruthless CIA officer Noah Vosen in ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" (2007), that propelled his career to a new level."

2140,Danny DeVito,11/17/1944,"Neptune Township, New Jersey, United States",https://resizing.flixster.com/r_IQ6PmJSUpv47IIrcOmIAgT1uQ=/218x280/v2/https://flxt.tmsimg.com/assets/426_v9_bc.jpg,"A raucous presence on television and feature films for decades, Danny DeVito transitioned from Emmy-winning comic actor on ""Taxi"" (ABC/NBC, 1978-1983) to bona fide movie star with ""Ruthless People"" (1987) and assured feature director (""Throw Momma from the Train,"" 1987) and producer of such hits as ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and ""Man on the Moon"" (1999). Born Daniel Michael DeVito, Jr., in an Italian household in Neptune Township, New Jersey on November 17, 1944, he gave his first performances as a student at Oratory Prep High School in Summit, New Jersey. Short of build - he stood 4'10"" as a result of the genetic disorder known as Fairbank's disease - and a moderate student, he initially pursued a career as a hairdresser at his sister's salon, which led to studying cosmetics at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City. Applicants were required to perform a monologue in order to enter the school's various programs, and the response he received for his audition convinced him that acting might be his career of choice. After completing his studies at the American Academy, DeVito made the rounds with East Coast theater companies, including the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Connecticut, where he befriended fellow aspiring actor Michael Douglas, and the Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective, where he met his future wife, actress Rhea Perlman. After a short stint in Los Angeles, DeVito returned to New York and made his screen acting debut in the independent film ""Dreams of Glass"" (1970). More minor roles in obscure films followed before Douglas cast him as a mental hospital patient in Milos Forman's adaptation of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" (1975). The popularity of the film led to character turns on television and in features, but his true breakout role came in 1978 when he was cast as Louie DePalma, the short-fused dispatcher for a New York taxi company on ""Taxi."" DeVito reaped numerous award nominations, including Emmy and Golden Globe wins in 1980 and 1981, and parlayed his popularity on the show into steady work as a character actor in features. He was a natural for abrasive, manipulative figures like the scheming con man on Douglas's train in ""Romancing the Stone"" (1984), but also showed a more kindly side in ""Terms of Endearment"" (1983) and Brian DePalma's ""Wise Guys"" (1986). During this period, DeVito also began making inroads to a directorial career: he helmed and starred in segments of a Cinemax anthology series called ""Likely Stories"" (1983), and made his feature-length debut in ""The Ratings Game"" (Showtime, 1984), a satire of the television business co-starring Pearlman. After starring in the big-screen comedies ""Ruthless People"" and ""Tin Men"" (1987), DeVito made his own feature debut as director with ""Throw Momma from the Train,"" a skewed take on Alfred Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" (1954) with DeVito roping Billy Crystal into a plan to murder his domineering mother. A surprise hit, it spurred DeVito to launch his own production company, Jersey Films, with Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher, which oversaw a remarkable array of popular films in the 1990s, including ""Reality Bites"" (1991), ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Out of Sight"" (1998) and ""Man on the Moon,"" which featured DeVito playing himself opposite Jim Carrey as his ""Taxi"" co-star, Andy Kaufman. During this period, DeVito continued to not only act in features, including two inspired turns opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Twins"" (1988) and ""Junior"" (1994), as well as  Norman Jewison's ""Other People's Money"" (1991) and a show-stopping performance as the disfigured Penguin in Tim Burton's ""Batman Returns"" (1992). DeVito also maintained his directorial career, turning the bitter comedy ""The War of the Roses"" (1989), which reunited him with his ""Romancing"" co-stars Douglas and Kathleen Turner, as well as an impressive crime epic in ""Hoffa"" (1992), with Jack Nicholson as the labor chief, and ""Matilda"" (1996), a spry and charming adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel. DeVito continued on this exceptionally busy path into the new millennium, and if some of his efforts as director, producer and actor were only middling - ""Drowning Mona"" (2000) and ""Death to Smoochy"" (2002) were just two of the many that failed to find an audience - the projects that did score as hits, like ""Erin Brockovich"" (2000), ""Garden State"" (2004) and ""Reno 911!"" (Comedy Central, 2003-09), which he produced, or ""LA Confidential"" (1997), the Disney animated feature ""Hercules"" (1997) and David Mamet's ""Heist"" (2002), all of which featured in character roles, were memorable. In 2006, he returned to network television as Glenn Howerton and Kaitlin Olson's perversely odd father on the cult comedy ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" (FX, 2005- ). But he remained doggedly active in all other areas of his career, logging voice-acting roles in ""The Lorax"" (2012) and producing numerous shorts and television episodes, while choosing to appear in an array of diverse live-action projects, including Todd Solondz's ""Wiener-Dog"" (2017), Burton's ""Dumbo"" (2019) and ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" (2019), as well as several episodes of Douglas's Netflix series, ""The Kominsky Method"" (2018- ). He also returned to feature directing after a 16-year absensce with the post-apocalypse drama ""St. Sebastian."""

His earliest big screen role was as Franklin Ford III, a fellow law student of Timothy Bottoms, in the 1973 drama ""The Paper Chase,"" which was followed by television films and series throughout the '70s and '80s. He was extremely prolific during the '90s, including a part in the HBO original movie ""Barbarians at the Gate""--about the machinations of a tobacco conglomerate behind closed doors--and appearances in two of the decade's most critically-acclaimed movies: the Coen Brothers Comedy ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and the neo-noir ""L.A. Confidential."" As Dick Stensland, the corrupt partner and mentor of Russell Crowe's character, Officer ""Bud"" White, he played a pivotal role in kicking off ""L.A. Confidential""'s labyrinth of a plot. His work during the '00s mostly consisted of single-episode appearances on television series, a notable exception being the science fiction show ""Battlestar Galactica,"" in which he had a recurring part as Colonel Jack Fisk, who may not be as ""by-the-book"" as he appears. Beckel walked a similar razor's edge between light and darkness as a guest star in the popular sci-fi series ""Heroes"" and crime comedy series ""Castle."" Meanwhile, his film appearances included collaborations with the idiosyncratic Michael and Mark Polish, in the 2006 drama ""The Astronaut Farmer.""

Once he gained notice from ""L.A.

Though he had made significant strides in his career, Baker's Hollywood fortunes fluctuated, thanks to a string of misfire movies like ""The Affair of the Necklace"" (2004) and ""The Ring Two"" (2005). He stepped up with key supporting roles in ""Something New"" (2006) and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2006), only to stumble when his regular role on the high-profile crime drama ""Smith"" (CBS, 2006) was cut short after only three aired episodes.

After depicting resident prankster-cum-womanizer Sergeant Nick Lassard in two installments of the hijinks-laden ""Police Academy"" franchise, he segued into more mature roles with the help of director Curtis Hanson, who cast him in the domestic thriller ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" (1992) and the crackerjack detective noir ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997). Over the course of the '90s and '00s, he earned the unique distinction of starring in three movies concerning the legendary Big Foot, including two unrelated family films and the gruesomely crafty monster mash ""Abominable."" With a pair of piercing blue peepers that lend him a passing resemblance to iconic actor James Stewart (who happens to be his role model), he is perhaps most recognized from his many prime-time television guest roles. While he's appeared in one-off and recurring roles on everything from the supernatural sideshow drama ""CarnivÃ le"" to the quirky police procedural ""The Closer,"" he became part of ""Seinfeld"" lore (and therefore part of TV history) with his portrayal of Lloyd Braun, a respected political-assistant-turned-mental-patient with access to a lot of gum."

But his road to stardom would prove to be difficult. In order to support himself, Mahon took on a series of odd jobs, including a bus boy and welfare worker, all while using any free time he had to audition. In 1965, his good friend from Scranton, actor and Pulitzer Prize- winning playwright, Jason Miller, moved in with him. It would be the start of a lifelong friendship that would ultimately result in Mahon's first screen role in 1973's ""The Exorcist,"" which also earned Miller an Oscar nod for his supporting role as Father Karras. From there Mahon's career took off and throughout the '70s and '80s he landed dozens of guest-starring roles on some of the most acclaimed cop dramas of the era, including ""The Rockford Files,"" ""Cagney & Lacey,"" and ""Hill Street Blues."" Mahon made a brief return to movies in the '90s, appearing in small roles in such celebrated dramas as 1992's ""One False Move,"" Rob Reiner's ""The American President,"" and 1997's ""L.A. Confidential."" By the first half of the 2000s, however, Mahon returned to television acting, where he was relegated to mostly small roles. In 2006 he received another big break, however, after he was cast in a recurring role on the short-lived Aaron Sorkin comedy, ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.""

His early roles, guest appearances in sitcoms like the short-lived ""Secret Service Guy"" and the Fran Drescher vehicle ""The Nanny,"" were entirely undistinguished, but his model-like looks garnered him a credit with considerably more credibility when he appeared in Woody Allen's ""Everyone Says I Love You"" as the date of co-star Natasha Lyonne's character. A year later, he landed the prime role of real-life gangster Johnny Stompanato (notorious for being murdered in 1958 by the daughter of his then-girlfriend Lana Turner) in Curtis Hanson's neo-noir classic ""L.A. Confidential."" Other supporting roles followed, in films as varied as the Brendan Fraser romantic comedy ""Still Breathing"" and Franco Zeffirelli's wartime period drama ""Tea With Mussolini,"" but Seganti probably remains best known to American audiences for his recurring role as heartbreaker Damien Grimaldi on the soap opera ""As the World Turns,"" on which he appeared sporadically between 1994 and 2006 before becoming a full-time character in 2009 and 2010.

As with seemingly everyone of his age who wielded a camera, Hanson had his start penning ""The Dunwich Horror"" (1970) for the definitive mentor, Roger Corman, before directing ""Sweet Kill"" (1973) for the low-brow producer. In the 1980s, he graduated to Hitchcockian thrillers like ""The Bedroom Window"" (1987) and ""Bad Influence"" (1990), which paved the way for his true breakthrough film, ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" (1992), a tense psychological thriller that became his first bona fide box office hit. Following the action adventure ""The River Wild"" (1994), Hanson reached true artistic heights with his lush adaptation of James Ellroy's ""L.A.

From there, he made the quirky adaptation of Michael Chabon's ""Wonder Boys"" (2000) before drawing a convincing performance from rap star Eminem in ""8 Mile"" (2002). After directing the dueling-sisters comedy-drama ""In Her Shoes (2005), poker drama ""Lucky You"" (2007) and television political drama ""Too Big to Fail"" (HBO 2010), Hanson fell ill with heart trouble during the filming of surf drama ""Chasing Mavericks"" (2012), causing the film to be finished by Michael Apted.

Because of his small screen success, he transitioned effortlessly to features where he became a highly sought-after actor capable of turning in rich and diverse performances. After making his mark as a basketball hustler in the surprise hit ""White Men Can't Jump"" (1992), Harrelson forever buried his nice guy persona by playing the sociopathic serial murderer Mickey Knox in Oliver Stone's searing satire, ""Natural Born Killers"" (1994). Harrelson went on to further acclaim and earned an Oscar nomination playing infamous pornographer and First Amendment rights activist Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" (1996). From there, he stayed mostly in independent films, playing a drunken louse of a husband in ""The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio"" (2005) and a strung-out addict in ""A Scanner Darkly"" (2006).

Abrams, Matt Reeves helmed one of the most popular and talked-about science fiction films of the early 21st century, ""Cloverfield"" (2008), as well as ""Let Me In"" (2010), a much-debated remake of the Swedish vampire film, ""Let the Right One In"" (2008) and ""The Batman"" (2018), following star Ben Affleck's decision to step away from the director's chair. Despite his love of genre film, Reeves' first came to prominence as the co-creator of ""Felicity"" (The WB, 1998-2002), a gentle college romance for teen audiences starring Keri Russell. Born Matthew George Reeves in Rockville Centre, NY on April 27, 1966, he was raised in Los Angeles, where he began making 8mm movies at the age of eight. As a teenager, he discovered that a local cable system was broadcasting homemade movies on its public access channel, and contacted the program, ""Word of Mouth,"" to air his own productions. Reeves not only managed to get his movies shown on the program, but was also interviewed by its host, Gerard Ravel. Through him, Reeves met J.J. Abrams, another aspiring teenage filmmaker, and Bryan Burk. The trio became fast friends and subsequent production partners. Reeves and Burk eventually attended the University of Southern California, where they collaborated on Reeves' thesis project, a short fantasy film called ""Mr. Petrified Forest,"" about a photographer obsessed with disaster. The project required a plane crash sequence, which Abrams returned from college on the East Coast to construct on the front yard of his parents' home. The short eventually turned up in the direct-to-video compilation film, ""Future Shock"" (1993). ""Mr. Petrified Forest"" made the rounds of student film festivals, where it netted not only an award but also an agent for Reeves. He soon set to work on several feature scripts, including an action-adventure film that later became the Steven Seagal picture ""Under Siege 2: Dark Territory"" (1995). After graduation, he completed the script for a black comedy called ""The Pallbearer"" (1996). The film starred David Schwimmer as a hapless twenty-something who becomes involved with both the mother (Barbara Hershey) of a friend he cannot remember, but also his long-ago high school crush (Gwyneth Paltrow). Produced by Abrams for Miramax, it did not connect with audiences, but helped to set Reeves' film career in motion. Reeves soon dove headlong into television, directing episodes of ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" (NBC, 1993-99) while co-creating ""Felicity"" (The WB, 1998-2002), a much-loved college drama about a plucky young woman (Keri Russell) who follows a college crush (Scott Speedman) to New York instead of pursuing a college degree at Stanford. Reeves also directed five episodes while collaborating with James Gray on the script for ""The Yards"" (2000), a noirish thriller with Mark Wahlberg as a recently paroled inmate who becomes embroiled with his uncle's (James Caan) shady business dealings. Shot in 1998, it was delayed due to issues with its studio, Miramax, and arrived in theaters, largely without fanfare, two years later. In 2008, Reeves shot to international attention as the director of ""Cloverfield,"" a clever and relentlessly jarring science fiction thriller about the arrival of a giant monster in New York City and its impact on the lives of several young people there. Shot in verite style with a single camera carried by one of the protagonists, the film spoke to post-9/11 fears while delivering a special effects tour de force. Its marketing campaign, built around a teaser trailer and several elaborate and deceptive web sites, built a year-long word of mouth for the film that resulted in a box office take that exceeded $100 million. ""Cloverfield"" also paved the way for Reeves to tackle other films; the first of which was a controversial remake of the Swedish horror film ""Let the Right One In"" (2008), about the relationship between a bullied young boy and his new neighbor, a young girl who turns out to be a vampire. An award-winning and popular feature, ""Let the Right One In"" was widely embraced by American audiences, who saw it during a limited theatrical run and on DVD; many of these viewers, as well as filmmaker Tomas Alfredson, who directed the Swedish version, reacted strongly against a stateside remake, which they viewed as pure Hollywood greed. Reeves stated in interviews that his approach would be an entirely different take on the source novel by Ajvide Lindqvist, who supported the new version, renamed ""Let Me In"" (2010). The film went on to both critical and commercial success. Reeves next stepped into the director's chair for the reboot ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014) and its sequel ""War for the Planet of the Apes"" (2017), and served as executive producer of ""spiritual sequel"" ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016). In early 2017, Reeves was announced as director of ""The Batman"" (2018) after star Ben Affleck announced that he was relinquishing the role of director to concentrate on his onscreen work in the film."

One of his first projects was a re-write of the original script for ""Constantine,"" an action-science fiction film directed by Francis Lawrence, adapted from a comic book. Not only were there accommodations made to the main character to make it a better fit for Keanu Reeves, but a lot of plot elements, locations, and aesthetic elements were changed as well for various production reasons. A few years later, Bomback wrote the final script for the fourth installment of the ""Die Hard"" action film series starring Bruce Willis, ""Live Free or Die Hard."" As with ""Constantine,"" there were several changes to the original script, as well as each subsequent script. One of the main reasons for the numerous re-writes was an effort to be more sensitive, as the project was originally supposed to have been released around the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks, and the plot's central theme dealt with terrorism against the United States In 2009, Bomback worked on the final script for the remake of the Disney science fiction adventure film ""Escape to Witch Mountain,"" called ""Race to Witch Mountain,"" directed by Andy Fickman. After Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) was cast in the lead role, Bomback was asked to modify the original script significantly, adding more dark elements to the plot and overall mood than were in the original film. In 2010, Bomback wrote the script for ""Unstoppable,"" an action/adventure thriller about a runaway train, for director Tony Scott, who is famous for the adaptation of another train-based thriller, ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3."""

Whishaw garnered considerable attention for his stage work with London's Royal National Theatre and the Old Vic, prior to appearing in such U.K.-produced films as Matthew Vaughn's ""Layer Cake"" (2004) and the Brian Jones rock-n-roll biopic ""Stoned"" (2005). Soon after, he made his belated entry into Hollywood as the star of the critically lauded period thriller ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"" (2007).

Although he remained a presence on such British TV projects as ""The Hour"" (BBC, 2011-12), the young actor was soon taking part in major feature blockbusters, including ""Cloud Atlas"" (2012) and the James Bond films ""Skyfall"" (2012) and ""Spectre"" (2015), in which he played tech wizard Q opposite his ""Layer Cake"" co-star, Daniel Craig, as well as prestigious films such as historical drama ""Suffragette"" (2015).

After breaking through with the Merchant-Ivory adaptation of ""The Remains of the Day"" (1993), Grant became a star with his turn as a charming, but stammering Brit unlucky in love in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994). But he became a household name not for any role he played, but because of one particularly embarrassing moment with a Hollywood prostitute that eradicated his somewhat wholesome image. A quickly forgiving public helped keep Grant in the spotlight, however, thanks to his performances in ""Nine Months"" (1995), ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995) and ""Notting Hill"" (1999). Grant's career hit new highs with ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001) and ""About a Boy"" (2002) - the latter of which widely regarded as the best performance of his career - and the cult favorite ""Love Actually"" (2003).

Born Julia Mary Walters in Edgbaston, a suburb of Birmingham, England on February 22, 1950, she was one of five children by English and Irish parents. By her own account, she was not an academic-minded child - she was dismissed from Holly Lodge Grammar School for Girls for misbehavior - and went to work at an insurance company at the age of 15. Walters briefly trained as a nurse at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, but left to pursue a long-standing dream of becoming an actor Studies in English and drama at Manchester Metropolitan University preceded her first stage roles with the Everyman Theatre Company, where she performed with fellow future stars like Jonathan Pryce, Bill Nighy and Pete Posthlewaite, with whom she was romantically involved during the 1970s. Stints in improvisational comedy and cabaret, as well as guest roles on television, preceded her first stab at stardom as a freethinking hairdresser from Liverpool who aspires to better herself in Willy Russell's play ""Educating Rita"" (1980). Walters earned critical raves for her performance, which was followed by a successful collaborative partnership with actress and playwright Victoria Wood, whom she had met while both were appearing in a 1978 sketch revue, ""In at the Death."" Their collaborations included a TV adaptation of Wood's play ""Talent"" (ITV, 1979) and two sketch comedy series, ""Wood and Walters"" (ITV, 1981-82) and ""Victoria Wood As Seen on TV"" (BBC Two, 1985-87), which yielded one of Walters' most popular comic characters, the elderly tea lady Mrs. Overall, on the soap opera spoof ""Acorn Antiques."" The character and sketch would earn a devoted fan following and an award-winning musical adaptation, directed by Trevor Nunn, in 2005. In 1983, Walters stepped into the spotlight in the film version of ""Educating Rita,"" directed by Lewis Gilbert and co-starring Michael Caine as the alcoholic professor whose love of literature is reignited by Walters' Rita. For her performance, Walters earned an Oscar nomination, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA for Best Actress in a Leading Role - the first of seven - and soon settled into steady character work in both dramatic and comedic features and television. Walters was a naÃ¯ve waitress who supplemented her income by renting her apartment to escorts in Terry Jones' ""Personal Services"" (1987), the playwright Joe Orton's mother in Stephen Frears' ""Prick Up Your Ears"" (1987), and a mother who becomes involved in Irish-English peace relations in ""Titanic Town"" (1998), one year before she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). On television, she reunited with Wood for a 1991 special, ""Julie Walters and Friends"" (ITV) and the series ""Dinnerladies"" (BBC One, 1998-2000), about workers at a factory canteen in Manchester. In 2000, she netted her second Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, as well as a second BAFTA, as the dedicated dance teacher of a young Irish boy in Stephen Daldry's ""Billy Elliot""; the success of the film led to a slew of high-profile film projects, including a recurring role as Molly Weasley in the ""Harry Potter"" film franchise, save for ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005).

Between these projects, Walters played Jane Austen's mother in ""Becoming Jane"" (2007), the vivacious Rosie in ""Mamma Mia!"" (2008), the kindly Mrs. Bird in ""Paddington"" (2014) and its 2017 sequel, and a feisty boardinghouse owner in ""Brooklyn"" (2015), which brought her 16th BAFTA nomination, while also finding time to be named Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2008. Walters remained remarkably busy in her sixth decade, penning a 2008 autobiography, That's Another Story, paying tribute to Wood, who died in 2016, with the documentary series ""Our Friend Victoria"" (BBC, 2017), enjoying major supporting roles in ""Mamma Mia!

He attended the State University of New York at Fredonia, but dropped out to join his older brother Harvey Weinstein in his blossoming career as a concert producer. In 1979, the brothers founded the film distribution company Miramax Films, which began with concert films like Paul McCartney's ""Rockshow"" (1980) and ""The Secret Policeman's Other Ball"" (1982) but quickly moved on to narrative features. Bob Weinstein himself tried his hand at screenwriting, first with the horror film ""The Burning"" (1981), and then with the comedy ""Playing for Keeps"" (1986), the latter of which he co-directed with his brother Harvey, but never pursued the craft thereafter. Among Miramax's most successful early outings were the comedy ""Working Girl"" (1987), Errol Morris' documentary ""The Thin Blue Line"" (1988), and the Daniel Day-Lewis-starring drama ""My Left Foot"" (1989). Throughout the 1990s, Miramax was instrumental in bringing attention to then-up-and-coming filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez, and Gus Van Sant. In the early 2000s, Bob Weinstein began producing Broadway plays, including ""The Producers"" (2001) and ""Sweet Smell of Success"" (2002), and branched out to the world of television by producing the reality show ""Project Runway"" (Bravo 2004-). In 2005, Bob and Harvey Weinstein left Miramax, at this point owned by Disney, to launch The Weinstein Company. October of 2017 saw the publication of articles in The New York Times and the New Yorker that detailed accusations against Harvey Weinstein of multiple instances of sexual assault and rape of several dozen women who had worked with him over the preceding decades. Bob Weinstein responded by decrying Harvey as ""sick and depraved"" and severing professional ties with his brother, but was later himself accused of sexual harassment of producer Amanda Segel, as well as of being complicit in having paid off Harvey's accusers in the past and further enabling his brother's allegedly abusive behavior. Nevertheless, Bob Weinstein maintained his attachment to The Weinstein Company and his role as an active producer."

The Italian master was nominated for an Academy Award in 2005 for ""Pride and Prejudice,"" and won a Golden Globe and Academy Award two years later for his work in the poetic film masterpiece ""Atonement"" (2007). Aside from his brilliant work in the film, Marianelli also wrote orchestral pieces for the BBC Symphony Orchestra and music for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Further accolades came Marianelli's way for his sweeping compositions featured in the historical epic ""Agora"" (2009), which was nominated for Spain's Goya Award, and work on such period films as ""Jane Eyre"" (2011) and ""Anna Karenina"" (2012). Capable of transporting audiences to the majesty and grandeur of the past, or relating the complex emotions of contemporary society, Marianelli could always be counted on to elevate any film fortunate enough to employ his skill."

2247,The Beatles,,Not Available,/assets/pizza-pie/images/poster_default.c8c896e70c3.gif,"Internationally acknowledged as the greatest rock band of all time, The Beatles did pretty much everything first and better than anyone else. They were initially inspired by the U.S. rock 'n' roll of the '50s and the British skiffle scene. They grew out of singer/guitarist John Lennon's '50s group The Quarrymen, which included singer/guitarist Paul McCartney and lead guitarist George Harrison. After Lennon's friend Stuart Sutcliffe joined on bass in 1960 they became The Beatles. Pete Best soon became the drummer, completing the first Beatles lineup. That summer they began playing residencies in the clubs of Hamburg, Germany, where they learned their trade through long nights of multiple sets playing covers and their first batch of original material. Sutcliffe defected to become a painter and McCartney shifted to bass. By 1961 they were a buzz band back home in Liverpool, especially at the Cavern Club, where they were seen by music biz entrepreneur Brian Epstein. He became their manager and started shopping them to record labels, originally receiving a deafening round of apathy. Eventually he snared a deal with EMI, after which Best was replaced by Ringo Starr (nee Richard Starkey). Their first single, 1962's ""Love Me Do,"" hit the U.K. Top 20, but the 1963 follow-up, ""Please Please Me,"" reached No. 2 and Beatlemania began sweeping the nation. Soon after, the fever spread to the U.S. with the international No. 1 ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand."" The band's first two U.K. LP's, Please Please Me and With the Beatles (both 1963), hit No. 1, and the U.S. debut album, 1964's Meet the Beatles, reached No. 1 in America. Thereafter, The Beatles were golden, an unstoppable hit machine as well as a rapidly evolving, endlessly innovative artistic entity fronted by two songwriting geniuses in Lennon and McCartney. ""A Hard Day's Night,"" the 1964 Beatles-starring movie whose soundtrack was their album of the same name, spread the legend even further, influencing untold numbers of new bands. The band began expanding its sound enormously on 1965's Rubber Soul and helped kickstart the psychedelic revolution with the one-two punch of 1966's Revolver and the following year's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, both wildly innovative and unprecedentedly influential. By 1968's eclectic, untitled double LP, which came to be known as The White Album, the band was beginning to fragment. But with longtime producer/mentor George Martin's help they pulled it all together for resounding last hurrah on 1969's Abbey Road. In April of 1970, McCartney announced his departure from the band, effectively ending The Beatles. The next month, Let It Be, consisting of pre-Abbey Road sessions with producer Phil Spector, was released, providing closure to The Beatles' saga. There wouldn't be another Beatles session until McCartney, Harrison, and Starr convened in 1995, 15 years after Lennon's assassination, to overdub parts on two Lennon demos (""Real Love"" and ""Free as a Bird"") for release as singles accompanying the ""Beatles Anthology"" documentary and album. On November 29, 2001 Harrison died of cancer. But The Beatles never ceased to be a key influence on each new generation of musicians."

The enduring status of those two appearances was due to his co-stars, the Beatles, but Spinetti's lively turns in these pictures made him both an audience favorite as well as a friend and collaborator with the band - John Lennon in particular. He burst onto the theater scene with a Tony-winning turn in the Broadway production of ""Oh! What a Lovely War!"" in 1964, which coincided with his appearances in the Beatles pictures. Spinetti soon became friendly with Lennon, and later collaborated on a stage play based on the musician's 1964 book In His Own Write. Though his Beatles credits remained his best known, Spinetti worked steadily in U.K. films and on television from the 1960s through the 2000s, primarily in comedies that showcased his knack for madcap characterizations. His passing in 2012 from prostate cancer brought to a close a long, celebrated performing career, as well as another element in the sprawling pop culture tapestry that was the Beatles' legacy."

Following her tenure at RADA, Quayle took to acting professionally, first in stage productions. Among her earliest gigs were the likes of ""Better Late"" by way of the 1956 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, though she quickly moved onto the Broadway stage, where she starred in the musical ""Stop the World - I Want to Get Off"" in 1962. The following year, Quayle on a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her turn in the show. Going forward, she leapt straight to the screen, making her movie debut in the Beatles-starring comedy film ""A Hard Day's Night"" (1964). Major films to follow included the James Bond comedy ""Casino Royale"" (1967) and the family adventure film ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" (1968).Â At this point a recognizable face, Quayle earned a recurring spot as a panelist on the British game show ""What's My Line?""

Following a long line of smaller movie appearances and short-lived television ventures, Quayle landed a starring role on the teen drama series ""Grange Hill"" (BBC One 1978-2008), playing the role of Mrs. Monroe for four years in the early 1990s. She retired from acting shortly afterward. In 2012, Quayle was diagnosed with dementia; on Aug. 16, 2019, she died at age 86."

As she got older, her interest turned towards acting, which led her to the University of Melbourne. Emerging with a degree in 2010, Debicki made her film debut in the Australian comedy ""A Few Best Men"" (2011). Fortuitously, Baz Luhrmann stumbled upon Debicki and casted her in the Leonardo DiCaprio-starring adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" (2013). Before following up her American acting debut, she took to the stage and performed alongside Cate Blanchett and Isabelle Huppert in ""The Maids"" from 2013 to 2014 in both Australia and New York. Returning to the screen, Debicki took on a few smaller roles in bigger movies, including ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" (2015), ""Everest"" (2015), and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (2017). She also was in the first season of the Tom Hiddleston-starring miniseries ""The Night Manager"" (BBC One/AMC 2016- ). 2018 was another busy year for Debicki, as she appeared in a variety of films, including the sci-fi thriller ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" (2018), animated film ""Peter Rabbit"" (2018), and most notably, the Steve McQueen and Gillian Flynn heist drama ""Widows"" (2018), where she drew critical acclaim and awards buzz.

In college, she was set to study music psychology, but an encounter with her Young Vic director convinced her to stick with it and train at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. In 2011, she played Deloris Van Cartier, the lead character in the U.K. tour of the musical ""Sister Act"" based on the 1992 film of the same name, starring Whoopi Goldberg in the role. Ironically, the role led to another staged musical version of a character created by Goldberg, when Erivo played the role of Celie Harris in the 2013 London production of ""The Color Purple,"" a role originated by Goldberg in the 1985 filmed version. In 2015, Erivo was the only member of the British cast to come with the show to Broadway, playing the same role to much acclaim, with Jennifer Hudson in the lead role. She followed this stage success with a recurring role in the historical drama ""Mr. Selfridge"" (PBS/ITV, 2013-).

Born and raised in the cosmopolitan city of Sydney, Weaver began acting on Australian television when she was still in her teens. She briefly entertained the idea of studying sociology in college after winning a scholarship, but decided to pursue acting instead. After nabbing small roles on Australian TV throughout the 60s, Weaver made her feature film debut in the 1971 comedy ""Stork."" From there, Weaver's career really began picking up steam, which allowed her steadily throughout the 70s and 80s. During this period Weaver appeared in films like ""Petersen"" (1974) and ""Caddie"" (1976), as well as recurring roles on ""Water Under the Bridge"" (1980) and ""The Challenge"" (1986-87), both of which were mini-series made in Australia. Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, Weaver had difficulty finding screen acting work, so she turned her attention to the stage. She began appearing in Australian productions of some of the most revered plays of the 20thÂ century, including ""Death of a Salesman"" and ""Streetcar Named Desire."" By the early 2010s, however, Weaver began appearing in films and on television once again. She earned an Oscar nod in 2010 for her role as the matriarch of a criminal family in Melbourne in ""Animal Kingdom,"" and followed that up with her second Oscar nomination for playing the doting mother of an emotionally exhausted man, played by Bradley Cooper, in 2012's ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Weaver also returned to TV with roles on Starz's ""Blunt Talk"" (2015-16) as well as the Epix thriller series ""Our Lady, LTD"" (Epix, 2019- ).

Though he started performing in the mid-1970s as part of an Irish acting company, Neeson earned international prominence years later when he played the flawed, but ultimately redemptive German industrialist in ""Schindler's List"" (1993), which earned him his first Academy Award nomination. Neeson would sink his teeth into ""Michael Collins"" (1996), playing an Irish hero revered by multiple generations, then settled into a series of lesser known, but no less accomplished performances in features, including a compelling performance in the title role of ""Kinsey"" (2004). Along with turns as Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn in ""Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" (1999), Zeus in the remake of ""Clash of the Titans"" (2010) and John ""Hannibal"" Smith in ""The A-Team"" (2010), Neeson developed an unexpected second career as a middle-aged action hero in the thriller ""Taken"" (2008) and its sequels, making him an international box office heavyweight as well as a respected character actor. Shockingly widowed in 2009 after his wife, actress Natasha Richardson, passed away after a ski-related concussion, Neeson continued to work steadily, becoming admired as much for the strength of character he exhibited in the wake of the family tragedy as he was for his acting talent. Whether appearing in big-budget blockbusters like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012) or smaller fare like ""Chloe"" (2009) and Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" (2016), Liam Neeson consistently delivered quality work in both leading and supporting roles."

Born in Copley, OH in 1981, Coon first developed a love of acting during her English and Spanish studies at the University of Mount Union when, as a freshman, she successfully auditioned for the Department of Theatre's production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" Following her graduation, she went onto earn an M.F.A. in acting from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, spent four years working with the American Players Theatre and landed various voiceover and training video roles before moving to Chicago where she joined the Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Coon appeared in various plays including ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" ""The Merchant of Venice"" and ""The Night of the Iguana,"" and also found the time to make her first on-screen appearance when she landed a guest role in the short-lived '60s-set drama, ""The Playboy Club"" (NBC, 2011). In 2013, Coon received a Tony Award nomination for her debut Broadway performance as Honey in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,"" and added to her television credits with one-off parts in police procedural ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" (NBC, 1999-), the remake of classic detective show ""Ironside"" (NBC, 2014) and espionage drama ""Intelligence"" (CBS, 2013-14).

Coon's profile received a further boost later that year when she played Margo Dunne, the supportive twin sister of Ben Affleck's Nick, in David Fincher's engrossing mystery, ""Gone Girl"" (2014).

He had his breakout role at eight years old as an Amish boy who witnesses a murder in the big city in ""Witness"" (1985). From there, Haas delivered an emotionally impactful portrait of the real-life Ryan White, who contracted the AIDS from a blood transfusion and sparked a national debate, in ""The Ryan White Story"" (ABC, 1988).

He played football in high school and majored in psychology at Northern Illinois University, but he gravitated toward comedy performance after graduation.

While the troubling nature of her novels such as Dark Places (2009) and Gone Girl (2012) often suggested a troubled past, Flynn's childhood was nothing short of normalcy. She was born on February 24, 1971 in Kansas City Missouri. As a young child, she had a penchant for stories and she found the ones she found in books and movies to be especially captivating. Although she herself admittedly thought she reading and watching things that were beyond her age -- such as ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967) when she was seven-years-old -- Flynn grew up much like the rest of her peers. She attended the University of Kansas and received her degree in English and journalism. Flynn headed west to California where she stayed for two years writing about human resources for a trade magazine. Afterwards, she moved to Chicago to pursue her Masters degree in journalism at Northwestern University and soon contemplated a career as criminal reporter. However, those years reading and watching mature subject matter did little to prepare the nerveless Flynn. Instead she put her movie expertise and journalism degree to use as a reporter for Entertainment Weekly magazine. For the next ten years, she flew in and out of the magazine's New York office to visit the film sets all around the world, including a trip to New Zealand for ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy. While she was jet-setting around the globe, Flynn began to work on her first novel. Published in 2006, Sharp Objects told the story of Camille Preaker, a journalist from Chicago who returns to her hometown to report on a series of brutal murders. Flynn's literary debut was a critical success; Sharp Objects became an Edgar Award finalist and won two of the Crime Writers' Association Dagger Awards in 2007. Her next novel, Dark Places, delved into a bleaker world than its predecessor, one that was explored societal classes and Satanic cults. However, unlike her first novel, much more was at stake with the publication of Dark Places. Just months before the book's release in 2009, Flynn was part of a wave of layoffs due to budgetary constraints at Entertainment Weekly, where she had spent the last four years as the magazine's TV critic. Fortunately, Dark Places was a bona fide success. It was listed on the New York Times Best Seller List for hardcover fiction for two consecutive weeks, was a nominee for the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award as one of the year's best thrillers, and nabbed the Black Quill Award for Dark Genre Novel of the Year. Flynn released her third novel Gone Girl in 2012, which was her best-selling book to date with over two million copies sold in print and digital editions. The success of Flynn's novels did not go unnoticed by Hollywood and soon enough the movie rights of her works were sold. The movie adaptations of Dark Places and Gone Girl were released in the fall of 2014. The highly anticipated latter was directed by Academy Award-nominated director David Fincher and starred Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as the seemingly normal couple torn apart by an unexpected crime."

Van Etten was born on February 26, 1981 in Clinton, New Jersey, as the middle of five kids, with an older brother, a younger brother, and two sisters. The family had a big LP collection that Sharon would plunder and enjoy, and she also sang in choir, and played clarinet, violin and piano. Van Etten started taking singing more seriously in high school. She taught herself how to play guitar, and learned how to craft harmonies by singing in her school choir. Van Etten went to college at Middle Tennessee State University, studied recording, and dropped out, going to work at the Red Rose, a combination coffee shop, record store, and music venue in Nashville. She didn't perform for five years because her boyfriend didn't think she had any talent, but she finally left him and went back home to New Jersey. Finally settling in Brooklyn, Van Etten sold hand-designed CDs on her website, and learned the ropes of the music business working as a publicist at the indie label Ba Da Bing Records. Van Etten's music was discovered by Kyp Malone from the art rock band TV on the Radio, and his brother Colin started playing it on NPR's music podcast All Songs Considered. Her music also got a lot of play on freeform radio powerhouse WFMU by Jeffrey Davison, a DJ who later became a close friend and collaborator. Van Etten's first album, Because I Was in Love, came out on May 26, 2009. Her second album, the ironically titled Epic came out in 2010. Both albums were critically well-received but sold little. By contrast, her third album Tramp (2012), went to number 75 on the Billboard charts. The follow up, Are We There (2014) garnered the best reviews and strongest sales of her career to date, including a four-star review in Rolling Stone and a high 8.2 rating from the influential online review site Pitchfork."

Elgort's career as a professional actor began when he starred in Matt Charman's Off-Broadway play ""Regrets"" (2012). Following his stage debut, Elgort was cast as Carrie's ill-fated prom date Tommy Ross in Kimberley Peirce's remake of ""Carrie"" (2013) alongside ChloÃ« Grace Moretz. Elgort then starred opposite Oscar nominee Shailene Woodley in ""Divergent"" (2014), a science-fiction thriller about a future dystopian society. The two rising young stars were immediately paired again for the teen romantic drama ""The Fault in Our Stars"" (2014) directed by Josh Boone before rejoining for ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" (2016). After a small cameo in ""Paper Towns"" (2015), another film based on a novel by ""The Fault In Our Stars"" author John Green, Elgort starred in Edgar Wright's action comedy ""Baby Driver"" (2017) as a music-obsessed getaway driver."

With her alluring model-like features, James eased into a recurring role on the sleek dramedy ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"" (ITV, 2007-2011), and made her leap to Hollywood with a bit part in the big-budget fantasy/adventure sequel ""Wrath of the Titans"" (2012). Continuing her fast rise in the film and TV ranks, she became a featured guest star on ""Downton Abbey"" just as the show was hitting new heights in its popularity. James subsequently made headlines when she was cast as the title character in Disney's live-action remake of the classic ""Cinderella"" tale.

His talents helped to elevate the band from offbeat funk-punk act to a genuine rock band, with Grammys and a worshipful fan base laying credence to the title. He was a respected figure in rock, as well as an in-demand guest player for the likes of Alanis Morrissette, Jane's Addiction, Johnny Cash, Tom Waits, Jewel and countless others.

As a young teenager, Ferreira aspired to become a recording artist and began maintaining a MySpace profile where she uploaded demos of tracks she had written herself. Her ambitions finally paid off when she signed a contract with Capitol Records in 2009. She subsequently released three singles in 2010; among them was the song ""Obsession"" which hit number 37 in the US Dance charts. Ferreira then put out two extended plays, As If in 2011 and Ghost in 2012; the latter featured her critical breakthrough ""Everything Is Embarrassing,"" co-written and produced by Dev Hynes. In 2013 she released her first full length album, Night Time, My Time. Although the album received favorable reviews from critics, Night Time, My Time was not without controversy, which mostly stemmed from the album's cover, which featured a 21-year-old Ferreira topless and sullen-looking in a pointedly unglamorous shower scene, photographed by transgressive filmmaker Gaspar Noe. In the same year, she ventured into the movies for the first time with an appearance on the cannibal horror-themed film, ""The Green Inferno"" (2013). After the release of Night Time, My Time, Ferreira's audience took on a global scale was she joined American pop star Miley Cyrus' international Bangerz Tour, which began in February 2014, as the concert tour's opening act.

Wright grew up in rural England, so obsessed with ""Star Wars"" and horror films that in his early teens, he made his own movies with a second-hand 8mm camera.

Fellner began his career for Zoetrope, a music video production outfit in Britain, and eventually produced videos for Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, and Rod Stewart, among others. Fellner founded the Initial Pictures company with partner Scott Millaney in 1985, and they produced their first feature film, ""Sid and Nancy"" about the singer of the Sex Pistols, released in 1986. This was followed by the ""B movie"" homage, ""Straight to Hell"" (1987), as well as ""Pascali's Island"" (1988), starring Ben Kingsley. Fellner and Initial Pictures executive produced ""A Kiss Before Dying"" and ""Year of the Gun"" (both 1991) before he split with Millaney and joined Bevan in Working Title. Bevan had already split from his original partner, Sarah Radclyffe, having established himself with such projects as ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" (1985), and ""A World Apart"" (1988). Fellner and Bevan plunged the newly-vitalized Working Title into cutting-edge filmmaking, executive producing Tim Robbins' directorial debut, ""Bob Roberts"" (1992), then producing Vincent Ward's ""Map of the Human Heart"" (1993). That same year, 1993, they executive produced Mario Van Peebles' ""Posse."" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" which starred Hugh Grant in a look at love and commitment, followed in 1994, the same year Working Title first associated with the Coen Brothers with Fellner and Bevan and executive producers of ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" In 1995, they worked again with Van Peebles, and his father, Melvin Van Peebles as well, as executive producers of ""Panther,"" and also produced ""French Kiss,"" a comedy starring Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline, and ""Moonlight and Valentino,"" which while focusing on women and their need for love and relationships, may someday be best recalled as the film debut of Jon Bon Jovi. Also in 1995, Working Title associated anew with Tim Robbins for ""Dead Man Walking."" In 1996, came The Coen Brothers' ""Fargo,"" on which Fellner and Bevan were executive producers. They again worked with the Coens in 1997 on ""The Big Lebowski.""

Though Chasin herself hasn't received any award accolades, several of her films have: in 1998, she co-produced the Oscar (and otherwise multi-award-winning) historical drama ""Elizabeth,"" which launched actress Cate Blanchett into stardom. In 2000, she executive produced the Golden Globe-nominated music geek comedy, ""High Fidelity""--which was written and directed by Brits but starred American John Cusack--and in 2001, she co-produced the romantic comedy ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" a huge hit which was also written and directed by Brits but again starred an American (Renee Zellweger)--with a rather convincing English accent. Among Chasin's numerous highlights are the 2002 romantic comedy ""About a Boy,"" which starred ""Bridget Jones"" alum Hugh Grant, and, in a far more serious vein, the 9/11 plane high-jacking drama, ""United 93,"" which was directed by Englishman Paul Greengrass. Chasin also served as executive producer on two consecutive Joe Wright films: the 2005 romantic drama ""Pride & Prejudice,"" based on the Jane Austen novel, and the 2007 war drama ""Atonement,"" based on the novel by Ian McEwan.

The daughter of actors James Daly and Hope Newell, Ellen Tyne Daly was the second of four children. Raised in Westchester County, New York, she began her acting career appearing in summer stock productions with her family and earned her Equity card at age 15 after being cast in the title role of ""Jenny Kissed Me."" Fate dealt her a blow, however, when a prominent agent dismissed her performance in favor of one of his proteges, relegating Daly to a supporting role. Daly went on to train at Manhattan's American Musical and Dramatic Academy, finding a mentor in teacher Philip Burton. In 1966, she debuted on Broadway in a revival of ""The Butter and Egg Man"" and went on to land small roles in films and TV. By the mid-1970s, Daly's career was on the upswing. She earned great notices for her supporting turns as Jack Lemmon's daughter in the Americanized remake of ""The Entertainer"" (NBC, 1976) and picked up her first Emmy nomination for the marital abuse drama ""Intimate Strangers"" (ABC, 1977). Daly landed the pivotal role of the first female partner to Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry Callahan in ""The Enforcer"" (1976), but television proved to be where she made her mark. ""Cagney and Lacey"" had a long gestation period. Conceived in the mid-70s, it was produced as a TV-movie in 1981 with Loretta Swit as Cagney and Daly as Lacey. CBS decided to pick up the series option for the following year. With Swit tied to ""M*A*S*H"" (CBS 1972-83), Meg Foster stepped into the role of Cagney. CBS dumped Foster from the role after the first season, citing her similar coloring to Daly, as well as the perception of some that the two women were too tough and hard-edged. Sharon Gless joined Daly as the new Cagney in 1982 and the two gelled instantly, their screen chemistry softening the relationship. Over the course of the series' run, Daly won four Emmy Awards, an unprecedented achievement for a dramatic actress. When ""Cagney & Lacey"" faded in 1988, Daly chose to risk her reputation by headlining a stage revival of ""Gypsy,"" the musical that starred Ethel Merman on Broadway and Rosalind Russell on the screen. In November 1988, she premiered on Broadway and won that season's Tony Award as Lead Actress in a Musical. Not satisfied with her offers for starring roles in series, Daly chose to divide her attentions between the stage and screen. When Daly finally opted to return to weekly series work, she accepted the supporting role of Alice Henderson, a strong-willed Quaker running a mission school, on ""Christy"" (CBS, 1994-95), a part that brought her a fifth Emmy Award, making her the most honored primetime dramatic actress in the history of the award. She also agreed to reunite with Sharon Gless on several ""Cagney & Lacey"" TV-movies in which Mary Beth, now retired, is brought back into police service by her former partner. The first of what would become three such revivals decidedly won its Sunday night time period in November 1994. Having lost the chance to do ""Gypsy"" on TV (to Bette Midler), she displayed her musical talents as Mrs. Peterson in the 1995 ABC remake of ""Bye Bye Birdie."" She continued to lend her considerable talents to telefilms like ""The Perfect Mother"" (CBS, 1997), make guest appearances on sitcoms and accept the occasional feature role. Once again, Daly confounded conventional wisdom by letting her hair turn gray, allowing herself an age-appropriate figure and accepting the role of the title character's social worker mother in the hit drama ""Judging Amy"" (CBS 1999-2005). As Maxine, the plain-speaking actress portrayed a forthright, sometimes overbearing woman with strong opinions and a deep concern for her family. During the series' first four seasons, Daly earned four Emmy nominations as Best Supporting Actress in a Drama for her work (bringing her career tally to 14 nominations) and she took home the trophy in 2003 (her sixth overall). After the series came to a close, Daly co-starred in the TV movie ""Georgia O'Keeffe"" (HBO 2009) and made occasional guest appearances on TV series, but mostly concentrated on her stage work, including starring roles in two Terrence McNally plays, ""Master Class"" and ""Mothers and Sons,"" and a supporting role in the musical ""It Shoulda Been You."" On the big screen, Daly appeared in Michael Showalter's indie comedy-drama ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" (2015) opposite Sally Field and had a supporting role in superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017)."

His continued commitment to stand up and the release of his first comedy album ""My Name is Hannibal"" (Stand Up Records) saw him named by Variety in their ""10 Comics to Watch in 2010"" feature. He continued to write, including work on the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and the critically-acclaimed sitcom ""30 Rock"" (NBC, 2006-2013) in 2011. Despite his success on television (including multiple roles in the aforementioned ""30 Rock"") Buress continued to focus on his stand-up, constantly touring and hosting his own night at the Knitting Factory in Brooklyn. Rolling Stone name-checked Buress on their ""The 10 Funniest People, Videos and Things of the Coming Year"" countdown (Jan. 6, 2011). He continued appearing on late night talk shows, including one of the fastest rising comics working today"" (Nov. 3, 2011),""The Late Show with David Letterman"" (CBS 1993-) in 2011, ""Conan"" (TBS 2010-) in 2012, UK panel show ""8 out of 10 Cats"" (Channel 4 2005-) in 2012 and many more. His first full-length stand-up show ""Hannibal Buress: Animal Furness"" aired on Comedy Central in 2012, followed by his co-hosting role on the surreal talk show parody ""The Eric Andre Show"" (Cartoon Network, 2012-). A supporting role as affable dentist Lincoln Rice on the cult hit ""Broad City"" (Comedy Central 2014- ) introduced Buress to a wider audience, but his introduction to the mainstream came via a perplexing route. In 2014, a two-year-old joke about Bill Cosby's long-rumored history of sexual assault suddenly went viral on social media, eventually leading to the first high-profile investigations of the charges against the veteran comic. In the meantime, Buress' film career flourished with appearances in the romantic comedy ""Sleepwalk With Me"" (2012), coming of age indie ""The Kings of Summer"" (2013) and the Seth Rogen hit ""Neighbors"" (2014). Burress hosted his own series ""Why? with Hannibal Buress"" (Comedy Central 2015- ), followed by appearances in the Will Ferrell comedy ""Daddy's Home"" (2015) and the animated ""Angry Birds"" (2016)."

Although his appearances included relatively minor roles in a host of acclaimed series and films, he also appeared as one of Nick Fury's Howlin' Commandos, Jim Morita, in the critically-acclaimed Marvel adaptation ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011), as Chinese Triad leader Henry Lin in the biker gang drama ""Sons of Anarchy"" (FX 2008-2014), and playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's New York City period piece ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013). Born and raised in Chicago, Choi originally studied accounting, but left his undergraduate course against his parents' wishes to follow his dream of acting. After his studies he moved to Los Angeles, and was quickly rewarded with parts in minor television and direct to video movies, picking up some notable credits with small roles in ""The West Wing"" (NBC 1999-2006), ""Roswell"" (WB 1999-2001 / UPN 2001-02) and ""The King of Queens"" (CBS 1998-2007). A minor part in Steven Spielberg's Tom Hanks-starring immigration drama ""The Terminal"" (2004) fulfilled an acting ambition of his to work with the director. As his film profile got raised, the quality of his TV roles also went up, including roles in hits like ""24"" (Fox 2001-2010) and ""Glee"" (Fox 2009-2014). Later roles included a supporting part in 1980s action film remake ""Red Dawn"" (2012) and a recurring part in the short-lived television remake ""Ironside"" (NBC 2013) before his supporting role in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (2013) brought him a higher profile. Roles such as his villainous portrayal of Chinese-American mobster Henry Lin on ""Sons of Anarchy"" (FX 2008-2014) followed, Choi next co-starred in the short-lived drama ""Allegiance"" (NBC 2016) and appeared as Judge Lance Ito in ""The People Vs.

After getting her modeling start in Florida where she also briefly appeared in early episodes of ""Miami Vice"" (NBC, 1984-1990), Beauvais moved to New York City and began a lucrative career with the Ford Modeling Agency. Intent on working in film and TV, she eventually relocated to the West Coast and landed a spot on the melodrama ""Models, Inc."" (Fox, 1994-95). Although the show was quickly cancelled, Beauvais was soon on to bigger and better things with a leading role on the sitcom ""The Jamie Foxx Show."" During that time, she also took on work in films like ""Wild Wild West"" (1999) and ""Double Take"" (2001). Once again elevating the stature of her projects, she next joined the cast of the groundbreaking police drama ""NYPD Blue"" for three seasons. Other note-worthy roles included a turn alongside Forest Whittaker in the drama feature ""American Gun"" (2006), prior to her regular cast role on the legal comedy-drama series ""Franklin & Bash"" (TNT, 2011-14).

After graduating from the University of Michigan he went on to Harvard Law School, then worked as a corporate attorney for three years before deciding to chuck it and head for Hollywood. Once in Los Angeles, he found quick success, landing writing work on ""Big Wolf On Campus"" (ABC Family, 1999-2002), the Eddie Murphy animated comedy ""The PJ's"" (Fox, 1999-2001), and the sitcom ""The Geena Davis Show"" (ABC, 2000-2001). It was on ""The Geena Davis Show"" that Goldstein met his future writing partner, John Francis Daley, who was an actor on the show. Their collaboration first bore fruit in form of the script for a feature film, ""The $40,000 Man,"" that was purchased by New Line in 2007.  Although that film was never produced, the pair went on to write an episode of ""Bones"" (Fox, 2005- ), the crime procedural on which Daley co-starred. The duo hit box office gold with their film ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011), which became the highest-grossing black comedy of all time. Although the follow-up ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" (2013) did not fare as well, it was announced in 2012 that the pair would write and direct a reboot of ""National Lampoon's Vacation,"" with Ed Helms playing a grown up Rusty Griswold and Christina Applegate as his wife. The proposed film ended up being shelved over a dispute with the studio about ratings. In the meantime, Goldstein and Daley wrote the family-friendly animated sequel, ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2"" (2013) and a follow-up to their breakthrough hit, ""Horrible Bosses 2"" (2014). Goldstein and Daley's next project was the screenplay for mega-blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017)."

After becoming familiar faces and maybe even a household name, young actors generally wind up becoming more of a factoid or an answer to a trivia question than a serious actor. For John Francis Daley, who cut his teeth in ""Freaks & Geeks"" (NBC 1999-2000) and the 1994 touring production of ""The Who's Tommy,"" that wasn't the case. Despite finding success as a teenager, Daley bucked the trend, carving out a path that led to a career with many notable roles in television and film. Eventually he moved onto screenwriting, penning everything from R-rated comedies such as ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011) to family films such as ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2"" (2013) before moving into the director chair with their franchise reboot ""Vacation"" (2015) and scoring a blockbuster hit with their screenplay for ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017)."

Latcham grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where his likable persona and polite Midwestern manners easily earned him friends in high school-so much so that  he was voted Student Body President during his senior year. Latcham always had a love of movies, and all throughout high school dreamt of one day making a name for himself in Hollywood. After high school he moved to Illinois to attend Northwestern, which was located in Evanston, just outside of Chicago. Although Latcham studied speech while attending the university, he intended on moving to Hollywood after graduation to start his career in movies. To attain the real world experience he needed to make it in Hollywood, Latcham worked a number of odd jobs in the film and TV industry. He worked on the production of a TV commercial that was filmed in his native Tulsa; interned for the acclaimed indie movie studio Miramax; and even had his own brush with fame by winning a car during a 2001 appearance on ""The Price is Right"" (CBS, 1972- ). In 2003, shortly after graduation from Northwestern, Latcham packed his bags and moved to Hollywood. He got a low-level job working as an assistant for Ari Emanuel's, the inspiration for Jeremy Piven's Ari Gold on ""Entourage"" (2004-2011), entertainment agency Endeavor. Latcham quickly proved himself to be capable and effective at his job, and after a year at Endeavor, he began working for Marvel Studios. During his early tenure at Marvel, Latcham started off doing low-level production work, including working as a production associate on the 2006 animated film ""Ultimate Avengers"" (2006). His big break came in 2008 when he served as an Associate Producer on ""Iron Man"" (2008). That film, which was directed by Jon Favreau and starred Robert Downey, Jr., was a huge hit at the box office, which meant a promotion for Jeremy Latcham. On ""Iron Man's"" sequel, which was released in 2010, Latcham's role was bumped up to Co-Producer. ""Iron Man 2"" (2010) was also a big hit, which was an even bigger boost to Jeremy Latcham's still fledgling film producing career. By the early 2010's Jeremy Latcham was promoted to Marvel's Producer and Senior Vice President of Production and Development, which meant he was one of the most powerful decision-makers during the production of several of the studio's blockbuster films. During this period, Latcham was the Executive Producer on some of the most profitable films of the 2010s, including ""The Avengers,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017). By mid-2017, Latcham had executive produced a string of global hits, and was ready for his next challenge. He left Marvel Studios in August of 2017 to found his own film production company, Latham Pictures. As the Principal for Latham Pictures, which has a deal to produce films exclusively for 20th Century Fox, Latham produced his first film for the company in 2018-""Bad Times at the El Royale."" That film, which co-starred Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm and Dakota Johnson, received mostly positive reviews when it was released in the fall of 2018, despite grossing a mere $31 million at the box office. Despite the low-scale earnings of ""Bad Times at the El Royale,"" Latcham charged ahead, and continued to develop family-oriented films for 20th Century Fox as the head of his Latham Pictures production house."

Kirby enjoyed diverse, if sometimes brief, portrayals in the features ""Where The Buffalo Roam"" (1980), ""This is Spinal Tap"" (1984), and ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" (1987). It was, however, for two separate roles - in each of which he played Billy Crystal's best friend - that Kirby would be most remembered: in the oft-quoted romantic comedy ""When Harry Met Sally"" (1989), followed by ""City Slickers"" (1991).

He next appeared as an aspiring playwright in Fellini's critically acclaimed ""I Vitteloni,"" about the small-town lives of a group of friends. Soon thereafter he landed steady work in films like the World War I-based  romantic drama ""A Farewell to Arms"" and the ""A Day for Lionhearts,"" about the true story of four young Italian students who bombed an important German stronghold in Italy.

As Coppola was ingeniously reasserting the classical form with ""The Godfather,"" Marks was cutting his teeth with his first editing job, ""Parades"" (both 1972). Two years later, they teamed up (with collaboration from Peter Zinner and Barry Malkin) to produce one of the most smoothly edited films of any period, ""The Godfather, Part II,"" which not only functioned in the classical mode, but managed to cut between two time periods in an impressively modern fashion. Marks continued his association with Coppola and earned his first Oscar nomination for his stunning work on ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979)."

Through her ingenuity and vision, the costumer made a name for herself in the business, becoming known for her consistent competence and remarkable take on the style of the recent past, with her work on films set in early to mid 20th Century America emerging as particularly strong examples. With the advent of the supermodel and the increased visibility of designers, the general public has become more aware of the fashion industry. In previous years, Hollywood films served as the major influence on fashion, Marlene Dietrich's trousers, Joan Crawford's shoulder pads, Rita Hayworth's strapless dresses and Elizabeth Taylor's gown in ""A Place in the Sun"" are all examples of how movie designs introduced new looks and set popular style parameters in previous decades. Van Runkle grew up in this fashion atmosphere and started in Hollywood when the trend was on the wane, but with her film debut ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967), the designer managed to revive the influence of movie fashion. She outfitted Faye Dunaway in remarkable 1930s period costumes with a decidedly modern flavor that appealed to contemporary women, a look that gained international popularity. Van Runkle's designs for Bonnie consisted of loose fitting suits with unstructured soft lines, sleek maxi skirts and smart berets that added up to a look marrying classic sophistication to modern comfort and ease. The designer was nominated for an Academy Award for her work, and ""Bonnie and Clyde"" would remain the most significant example of film influencing fashion in later years."

The ""spaghetti Westerns"" of Sergio Leone and others helped introduce Morricone to global audiences, and his music - an arresting blend of orchestra, folk instruments, elements of pop and rock music and a wall of offbeat sounds ranging from vocal choruses to clanging bells, gunshots and whip cracks - helped to make him an international sensation. Morricone was adept at nearly every musical approach, from wistful melodies in ""Paradiso"" and ""Bugsy"" (1992) to thunderous suspense in ""The Untouchables"" to jazz, swing, bossa nova, proto-electronica, rock and avant-garde. In the five decades of his busy career, he garnered countless admirers and devoted imitators, all of whom paid fervent tribute to a composer whose talents were vast, far-reaching and altogether timeless. Even late in his career, Morricone was acclaimed as one of the greats, winning an Academy Award for his score to Quentin Tarantino's western drama ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015)."
